## Owner-Occupancy, Rental Terms, and Deed Restrictions

### Owner-Occupancy Requirements

**Can local agencies require owner-occupancy for an ADU?**

No. A local agency **cannot impose an owner-occupancy requirement** on any ADU. (Gov. Code, § 66315.)

**JADUs are different:** Owner-occupancy is required for JADUs. The owner must reside in either the single-family residence or the JADU. (Gov. Code, § 66333, subd. (b).)

### Rental Terms

**Are rental terms allowed?**

Yes. Local agencies may require that ADUs be used for rentals of terms **longer than 30 days**. (Gov. Code, § 66315.)

For **66323 Units**, rentals **must** be for terms longer than 30 days. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (e).)

**State preemption note:** Short-term rentals (fewer than 30 days) of ADUs can be prohibited by local agencies. This is a restriction cities **may** impose, and 66323 Units are subject to a mandatory 30-day minimum by state law.

### Deed Restrictions

**Can an affordable housing deed restriction be imposed on an ADU?**

No. A local agency cannot impose a deed restriction on an ADU. Government Code section 66315 establishes the maximum standards for evaluating an ADU on a single-family lot, and no additional standards beyond section 66314 may be used — including deed restrictions. A deed restriction is not a design or development standard and thus cannot be imposed. (Gov. Code, §§ 66315; 66314, subd. (b)(1).)

**JADU deed restrictions are required:** A local agency that adopts a JADU ordinance **must require** the recordation of a deed restriction that includes:

1. A prohibition on the sale of the JADU separate from the single-family residence
2. A restriction on the size and attributes of the JADU that conforms with state law

(Gov. Code, § 66333, subds. (c)(1), (c)(2).)
