## Permit Process — Ministerial Review, Timelines, and Deemed Approval

### Permitting Agencies

A **permitting agency** is any entity involved in the review of an ADU or JADU permit for which there is no substitute, including planning departments, building departments, utilities, and special districts. (Gov. Code, § 66313, subd. (k).)

### Ministerial Review Required

ADUs must be considered, approved or denied, and permitted **ministerially** — without discretionary review or a hearing. (Gov. Code, § 66317, subd. (a).)

- Development standards must be **objective** to allow ministerial review. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (b)(1).)
- Agency staff review applications using only checklists — no discretionary judgment, opinion, or subjective standards. (Gov. Code, §§ 66316, 66317, 66320.)

### Application Timeline

| Step | Timeframe | Citation |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Completeness review** | 30 calendar days from submission | Gov. Code § 65943(a) |
| **Approval or denial** | 60 days from receipt of complete application | Gov. Code §§ 66317(a), 66320(a) |
| **Deemed approved** | Automatic if agency fails to act within 60 days | Gov. Code §§ 66317(a), 66320(a) |

- If an application is **incomplete**, the agency must provide an **exhaustive list** of missing items, limited to items on the agency's submittal requirement checklist. (Gov. Code, § 65943, subd. (a).)
- Applicants must pay all applicable processing and permitting fees at the time of application.

### Applicant-Requested Delay

An applicant may request a delay for any reason. The 60-day period is **tolled** for the duration of the delay. (Gov. Code, § 66317, subd. (a).)

### Deemed Approved

An ADU application is **deemed approved** when the permitting agency fails to approve or deny a completed application within 60 days. (Gov. Code, §§ 66317, subd. (a); 66320, subd. (a).)

### Denial Requirements

When an application is denied, the permitting agency must provide:
- A **full set of comments** listing defective or deficient items
- A **description of how the application may be remedied**
- Comments from **all reviewers from every permitting agency**

The 60-day countdown continues until the complete list is provided. Following a denial, a resubmitted application **resets the 60-day period**. A local agency may charge a fee to process a resubmitted application. (Gov. Code, §§ 66317, 66320, 66335, subd. (c).)

### Certificate of Occupancy

Property owners must obtain a **Certificate of Occupancy** from the local agency prior to any residential occupancy of an ADU or JADU. (Gov. Code, § 66328; 2022 CBC, § 111.)

### CEQA Exemption

ADUs and JADUs approved ministerially are **statutorily exempt from CEQA** pursuant to Section 15268 (Ministerial Projects) of the CEQA guidelines and Section 21080(b)(1) of the Public Resources Code. ADU and JADU ordinances are also exempt from CEQA pursuant to Section 21080.17.

### Unpermitted ADUs Built Before 2020

A local agency **shall not deny** a permit for an unpermitted ADU constructed before January 1, 2020, due to building standard violations, non-compliance with State ADU Law, or local ordinance violations. The agency **may deny** only if:
- Correcting the violation is necessary to protect **health and safety** of the public or occupants, or
- The building is deemed **substandard** pursuant to Health and Safety Code § 17920.3.

(Gov. Code, § 66332, subds. (a), (b), (c).)

### Pre-Approved ADU Plans (AB 1332)

AB 1332 (Gov. Code, § 65852.27) requires local agencies to develop a program for the preapproval of ADU plans by January 1, 2025.

Key requirements:
- Local agencies must **accept ADU plan submissions for preapproval** from any party and approve or deny them pursuant to Gov. Code §§ 66314-66332.
- Local agencies must **post preapproved ADU plans** and the applicant's contact information on their website.
- Local agencies may also post plans pre-approved by other local or state agencies.
- Local agencies may **charge a fee** to an applicant for preapproval.
- An application for a detached ADU using a **preapproved plan** (from the local agency, another agency in the state, or a plan identical to a previously approved application) must be approved or denied within **30 days**. Plans must be valid within the current triennial California Building Standards Code rulemaking cycle.

### HCD Technical Assistance

Questions and requests for technical assistance about ADU application denials should be submitted through HCD's ADU Portal at https://www.hcd.ca.gov/policy-and-research/accessory-dwelling-units. Applicants should first work to address the denial with the permitting agency. HCD may provide technical assistance after an application has been submitted.
