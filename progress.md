# CrossBeam — Progress Log

---

## Tuesday, February 10 — 6:20 PM PST

**Day 1 wrap-up. Research + Planning + Skill Foundation.**

What got done today:
- Deep research on Claude Agent SDK, Vercel Sandbox hosting, skill architecture
- Reviewed all existing discovery calls, market research, hackathon rules
- Wrote project plan (`plan-crossbeam.md`)
- Converted the full 2025 HCD ADU Handbook (PDF, ~54 pages) into a structured Claude Code skill — 27 reference files organized by topic, decision-tree router in `SKILL.md`, and an `AGENTS.md` for Claude Code integration
- Wrote the composite skill plan (`plan-skill-aduComposite.md`)
- Attended hackathon kickoff and office hours
- Set up `.gitignore`, initialized repo, pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/mikeOnBreeze/cc-crossbeam

Where things stand:
- State-level ADU skill is solid. Tested it — routes correctly, references load.
- Plan is good. Know the architecture, know the priorities.
- Repo is clean and on GitHub.

What's next (Wednesday):
1. **ADU composite skill** — meld the state-level skill with Claude Code tooling
2. **City-level web search tool** — 480+ CA cities each have different ADU regs published online; need a skill that can navigate any city site, find the rules, and document them
3. **Agent harness** — Claude Agents SDK backend to orchestrate everything

**Final update for the day. Applied 2026 addendum. Calling it.**

- Applied the 2026 HCD ADU Handbook Addendum to the California ADU skill. Updated 15 reference files across the skill (compliance, glossary, legislative changes, ownership, permits, standards, unit types, zoning). The skill now reflects both the 2025 handbook and the 2026 addendum.
- Raw addendum text extracted and saved (`HCD-ADU-Addendum-2026-raw.md`)
- Skill update manifest, prompt, and kickoff docs created for traceability

Good first day. Blank page to a fully structured state-level ADU skill with 27 reference files, current through 2026. Research done, plan written, repo on GitHub. Heading to the gym.

**Picking up tomorrow:** composite skill, city-level web search, agent harness.
