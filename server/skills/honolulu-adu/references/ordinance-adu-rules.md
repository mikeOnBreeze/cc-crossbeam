# General ADU Rules (Honolulu)
## Permitted Zones
- ADUs are permitted on residentially zoned lots (R-3.5, R-5, R-7.5, R-10, R-20) and agricultural lots.
## Multiple Dwellings (Ordinance 25-2)
- Allowed: An ADU may be added on a property that already has multiple dwellings (e.g., a main house + an 'ohana unit).
- Prohibited: ADUs are not permitted on lots under a Condominium Property Regime (CPR). You cannot CPR a lot that contains an ADU.
## Owner Occupancy
- Recent legislation has relaxed owner-occupancy requirements, meaning the owner no longer strictly has to live in the primary dwelling or the ADU.
