# ADU Parking Requirements
## Standard Requirement
- An ADU generally requires one (1) off-street parking stall. The stall may be compact.
## Transit Exemption
- If the lot is located in the Primary Urban Center or Ewa Development Plan area, the off-street parking stall is waived if the property is within **800 feet of a bus stop**.
- Exception: The parking waiver does not apply if a parking adjustment has already been taken for an existing 'ohana unit on the property.
