MAXIMUM INCREMENTAL REACTIVITY (MIR). The maximum change in weight of ozone formed by
adding a compound to the "Base Reactive Organic Gas (ROG) Mixture” per weight of
compound added, expressed to hundredths of a gram (g 0°/g ROC).

Note: MIR values for individual compounds and hydrocarbon solvents are specified in CCR,
Title 17, Sections 94700 and 94701.

MOISTURE CONTENT. The weight of the water in wood expressed in percentage of the weight
of the oven—dry wood.

PRODUCT-WEIGHTED MIR (PWMIR). The sum of all weighted—MIR for all ingredients in a product
subject to this article. The PWMIR is the total product reactivity expressed to hundredths
of a gram of ozone formed per gram of product (excluding container and packaging).

Note: PWMIR is calculated according to equations found in CCR, Title 17, Section 94521 (a).

REACTIVE ORGANIC COMPOUND (ROC). Any compound that has the potential, once emitted, to
contribute to ozone formation in the troposphere.

voc. A volatile organic compound (VOC) broadly defined as a chemical compound based on
carbon chains or rings with vapor pressures greater than 0.1 millimeters of mercury at
room temperature. These compounds typically contain hydrogen and may contain oxygen,
nitrogen and other elements. See CCR Title 17, Section 94508(a).

4.503 FIREPLACES

4.503.1 GENERAL. Any installed gas fireplace shall be a direct-vent sealed-combustion type. Any installed
woodstove or pellet stove shall comply with U.S. EPA New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) emission limits as
applicable, and shall have a permanent label indicating they are certified to meet the emission limits. Woodstoves,
pellet stoves and fireplaces shall also comply with applicable local ordinances.

4.504 POLLUTANT CONTROL

4.504.1 COVERING OF DUCT OPENINGS & PROTECTION OF MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT DURING
CONSTRUCTION. At the time of rough installation, during storage on the construction site and until final

startup of the heating, cooling and ventilating equipment, all duct and other related air distribution component
openings shall be covered with tape, plastic, sheet metal or other methods acceptable to the enforcing agency to
reduce the amount of water, dust or debris which may enter the system.

4.504.2 FINISH MATERIAL POLLUTANT CONTROL. Finish materials shall comply with this section.

4.504.2.1 Adhesives, Sealants and Caulks. Adhesives, sealant and caulks used on the project shall meet the
requirements of the following standards unless more stringent local or regional air pollution or air quality
management district rules apply:

1. Adhesives, adhesive bonding primers, adhesive primers, sealants, sealant primers and caulks
shall comply with local or regional air pollution control or air quality management district rules where
applicable or SCAQMD Rule 1168 VOC limits, as shown in Table 4.504.1 or 4.504.2, as applicable.
Such products also shall comply with the Rule 1168 prohibition on the use of certain toxic
compounds (chloroform, ethylene dichloride, methylene chloride, perchloroethylene and
tricloroethylene), except for aerosol products, as specified in Subsection 2 below.

2. Aerosol adhesives, and smaller unit sizes of adhesives, and sealant or caulking compounds (in
units of product, less packaging, which do not weigh more than 1 pound and do not consist of more
than 16 fluid ounces) shall comply with statewide VOC standards and other requirements, including
prohibitions on use of certain toxic compounds, of California Code of Regulations, Title 17,
commencing with section 94507.

4.504.2.2 Paints and Coatings. Architectural paints and coatings shall comply with VOC limits in Table 1 of
the ARB Architectural Suggested Control Measure, as shown in Table 4.504.3, unless more stringent local limits
apply. The VOC content limit for coatings that do not meet the definitions for the specialty coatings categories
listed in Table 4.504.3 shall be determined by classifying the coating as a Flat, Nonflat or Nonflat-High Gloss
coating, based on its gloss, as defined in subsections 4.21, 4.36, and 4.37 of the 2007 California Air Resources
Board, Suggested Control Measure, and the corresponding Flat, Nonflat or Nonflat-High Gloss VOC limit in
Table 4.504.3 shall apply.

Limits for ROC in Section 94522(a)(2) and other requirements, including prohibitions on use of certain toxic
compounds and ozone depleting substances, in Sections 94522(e)(1) and (f)(1) of California Code of
Regulations, Title 17, commencing with Section 94520; and in areas under the jurisdiction of the Bay Area Air
Quality Management District additionally comply with the percent VOC by weight of product limits of Regulation
