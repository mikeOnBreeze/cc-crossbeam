REQUIRED.

2. APPROVAL BY THE INSPECTOR DOES NOT MEAN APPROVAL OF FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE
PLANS OR SPECIFICATIONS. ANY DETAIL THAT FAILS TO BE CLEAR OR IS AMBIGUOUS MUST BE
REFERRED TO THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER FOR INTERPRETATION OR CLARIFICATION.

3. STRUCTURAL WOOD. PERIODIC SPECIAL INSPECTION IS REQUIRED FOR WOOD SHEAR WALLS,
SHEAR PANELS, AND DIAPHRAGMS, INCLUDING NAILING, BOLTING, ANCHORING, AND OTHER
FASTENING OF COMPONENTS OF THE SEISMIC FORCE RESISTING SYSTEM, INCLUDING WOOD
SHEAR WALLS, WOOD DIAPHRAGMS, DRAG STRUTS, BRACES, SHEAR PANELS, AND HOLDOWNS.
EXCEPTION: SPECIAL INSPECTION IS NOT REQUIRED FOR WOOD SHEAR WALLS, SHEAR PANELS
AND DIAPHRAGMS, INCLUDING NAILING, BOLTING, ANCHORING AND OTHER FASTENING TO
OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE SEISMIC-FORCE-RESISTING SYSTEM, WHERE THE FASTENER
SPACING OF THE SHEATHING IS MORE THAN 4 INCHES ON CENTER (O.C.). INSPECTIONS SHALL
BE PERFORMED BEFORE COVERING.

4. CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A WIND OR SEISMIC FORCE RESISTING
SYSTEM/COMPONENT LISTED IN THIS STATEMENT OF SPECIAL INSPECTION SHALL SUBMIT A
WRITTEN STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CITY INSPECTORS AND THE OWNER PRIOR TO
THE COMMENCEMENT OF WORK ON SUCH A SYSTEM OR COMPONENT PER SEC 1704.4.

5. PROVIDE DEPUTY INSPECTOR FOR CONCRETE, REINFORCING STEEL, AND EPOXY DOWELS.
