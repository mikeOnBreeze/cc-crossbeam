## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Window Schedule, Door Schedule, Walls Legend: mostly legible
- Title block information: clear
- Room layout and electrical symbols: clear
- Egress standards and notes section headers: clear

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Many of the right-side notes (Kitchen Electrical, Smoke/CO, Plumbing Fixtures) are partially obscured by the large diagonal watermark text
- Specific code section references (e.g., R702.4.2, CEC 406.12E) may have minor transcription errors
- Some table cells in the schedules were difficult to read at this resolution
- Shower/Bath Notes item 3 text is significantly obscured
- Some GPM/GPF values in Plumbing Fixture Notes may be approximate

### Items That Could Not Be Read
- Several continuation notes (items numbered beyond what was legible)
- Some dimensions within the floor plan itself (small text at drawing scale)
- Exact wire gauge specifications in electrical notes
- Some specific NEC/CRC code reference numbers
