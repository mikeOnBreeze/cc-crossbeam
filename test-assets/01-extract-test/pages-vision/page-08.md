## Statement of Special Inspection (Top-Left Zone)

1. Continuous and periodic special inspection is required for the work as described in CBC. An engineer or architect of record is responsible when special inspection is required.
2. If the special inspector does not have approval or failure to comply with plans or specifications, any item that fails to be clear or is ambiguous must be reported to the engineer of record and building official.
3. Structural wood: Periodic special inspection is required for wood shear walls, wood shear wall sheathing, wood diaphragms, wood braced walls, and related fastening of components of the seismic force resisting system, including wood shear walls, wood diaphragms, drag struts, braces, shear panels, and hold-downs. Exception: Special inspection is not required for wood shear walls, shear panels and diaphragms, including nails, bolts, anchoring and other fasteners to concrete and masonry, where the fastener spacing of the sheathing is more than 4 inches on center (O.C.). Inspections shall include nailing of sub-diaphragms.
4. Contractors responsible for construction of a wind or seismic force resisting system/component listed in this statement of special inspection shall submit a written statement of responsibility to the city inspector and the owner prior to the commencement of work on such a system or component per CBC 1705.
5. Provide deputy inspection for concrete, reinforcing steel, and epoxy dowels.

## Concrete (Top-Center Zone)

1. Concrete is permitted and placed per construction/approved notes. Where references or not specifically shown or where details are not given, provide reinforcement similar to that shown for similar conditions, subject to review by the design engineer.
2. All pieces of work pertaining to the concrete construction shall conform to the latest edition of ACI 318 "Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete" and ACI 301 +/-1/2" tolerances for tolerance per concrete construction.
3. All structural concrete shall have a minimum compressive strength at 28 days and a max slump as noted below:

| Location | Strength | Slump | Type of Concrete |
|---|---|---|---|
| All locations (u.n.o.) | 2,500 PSI | 6-8S | Normal wt. |

4. Concrete mixes shall be prepared with Type V Portland cement conforming to ASTM C-150.
5. Normal weight concrete aggregates shall conform to ASTM C33. Light weight concrete aggregates shall conform to ASTM C330.
6. Water used in mixing concrete shall conform with ASTM C-1602.
7. Thoroughly clean and roughen all hardened concrete and masonry surfaces that are to receive new concrete. Vertical surfaces shall be roughened to a full amplitude of 1/4" unless noted otherwise.
8. Where dowels (such as, but not limited to, connectors, pins, or reinforcing bars) are to be placed into or thru concrete member, direct contact of such members or such elements, and as noted to comply with 2022 CA plumbing code. All drill and epoxy-type dowels (embedded in hardened concrete or masonry) and adhesive anchors shall be specified by or obtained by GC from designer/superintendent/special inspector. (Various installation provisions follow.)
9. Non-shrink cement grout shall have a minimum 28-day compressive strength of 7000 psi. Use quantity (area) as low (minimum) as possible.
10. Defective concrete (voids, rock pockets, honeycombing, etc.) shall be removed and replaced as directed by the structural engineer.

## Reinforcement (Center-Left Zone)

1. All reinforcing bars shall conform to ASTM A-615, Grade 60, unless noted otherwise.
2. Smooth dowels: ASTM A36, A36 KSI.
3. Rebar shall have the following concrete cover set as required per code:
   - 3" against earth
   - 2" at footings/beams cast against earth
   - 1-1/2" for concrete exposed to weather (#6 and larger)
   - 1" for concrete exposed to weather (#5 and smaller)
   - 3/4" for concrete not exposed to weather - 1-1/2"
4. Bars shall be firmly supported and accurately placed as required by the ACI standards. Laps, tie and support bars and/or in accordance to design/drawings. Where necessary for firm and accurate placing, provide dowels to match. All reinforcement at floor unless or where noted otherwise. All dowels and splices per applicable code.
5. All principal rebar shall terminate with a standard hook minimum unless specifically detailed otherwise. Rebar detail shall be made cold. Rebar shall not be spliced with any portion of the bar is engaged in concrete.
6. All lap splices are Class "B" lap splices unless noted otherwise.

## General (Top-Right Zone)

1. All new construction shall comply with the contract documents and the 2022 California Building Code.
2. Notes and details on the structural drawings take precedence over these standard practice notes. Structural notes appear as typical/general information applicable to all structural elements shown. Notes apply to the referenced component as typically used. Staking, notes, and the drawings/details shall be inherently modified to the differing conditions of applications of the various elements as shown in the drawings. All standard notes, details and drawings may be modified.
3. The engineer reserves the right to review the various elements as detailed. All major structural members shall be reviewed as to the amount of deflection, material usage, and sizing for the area in this locale.
4. Any structural changes to the proposed plans in or thru slabs, beams, or other structural elements for routing of any plumbing, HVAC or electrical lines shall have the prior approval of the structural engineer.
5. All materials and workmanship shall conform to the requirements of the 2022 CBC.
6. All dimensions and elevations are to be verified in the field by the contractor, and contractor shall apply continuously and not to any temporary steel.
7. Report immediately to project structural engineer to design all temporary steel erection procedures.
8. Contractor shall contact engineer if excavation reveals unfavorable conditions. The services of a soils engineer, where indicated, shall be retained as required.
9. All footing pads shall bear a min of 12" below the lowest adjacent grade and a minimum of 18" and native soil. Wherever governs unless noted otherwise.
10. Excavation shall be properly backfilled, and fill shall be compacted to a minimum of 90% relative compaction.
11. Remove abandoned footings, utilities, etc. which may interfere with new construction, unless otherwise directed.

14. Provide bracing and standing water from excavations prior to placing concrete.
15. Notify the owners representative if any buried structures not indicated (such as footings, pipelines, etc.) are encountered.

## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information (firm, address, sheet number)
- Design criteria values (seismic parameters, wind speed)
- Concrete strength table
- General notes structure and content
- Reinforcement cover requirements

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some values in the special inspection table are partially obscured by the watermark
- S1 spectral acceleration value is partially obscured
- Some sub-items in the reinforcement and concrete sections are difficult to read due to small text and watermark overlay
- Specific code reference numbers in the special inspection table partially obscured
- Some decimal values in the design criteria section are hard to distinguish
