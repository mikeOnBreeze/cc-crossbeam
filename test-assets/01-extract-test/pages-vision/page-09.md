## Mechanical and Adhesive Anchors (Center Zone)

1. Adhesive anchors and dowels installed into concrete: A) Test to 200 lbs per dowel and record the results. B) Install per the manufacturer's published instructions.
2. Adhesive anchors: ASTM A-307, threaded rods with ASTM A-563 Grade A nuts and ASTM F436-1 flat washers, unless otherwise noted. Anchors designated as ASTM A-193 Grade B7 threaded rods to ASTM A-563 Grade C heavy hex nuts and ASTM F436.
3. Adhesive dowels: ASTM A-615, Grade 60 reinforcing steel.
4. All anchors shall be installed in accordance with ICC-ES report and COLA report and manufacturer's installation recommendations.
5. Unless otherwise noted, provide minimum embedment of anchors per ICC-ES report. COLA report and/or manufacturer's recommendation.
6. Prior to all drilling or coring, the contractor shall (1) verify the existing concrete or masonry thickness to prevent damage to the opposite face of concrete and masonry, (2) cut concrete/block, and (3) verify existing steel reinforcing locations by pachometer, (4) engineer to review installation.
7. If reinforcement is encountered during drilling, abandon and shift the hole location as allowed per the applicable ICC-ES report. If multiple holes are encountered by the rebar(s), or sound concrete between the dowel and the abandoned hole, fill the abandoned hole per the ICC-ES report/manufacturer's instructions. If neither of the above is noted above, the engineer will determine a new location.
8. All adhesive anchors shall be proof verified by a testing and inspection agency. Test 10% of all anchors.
9. Test anchoring no sooner than 24 hours after installation.
10. Each test (load) on any adhesive shall follow applicable load or tension on the anchor such as direct pull with a hydraulic jack, torque wrench, or calibrated spring-type tension.
11. Adhesive anchors shall be installed in concrete or grout having a minimum age of 21 days at the time of anchor installation.

## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Nailing schedule table (clearly legible, well-structured)
- Title block information
- Structural wood species and grade requirements
- Mechanical and adhesive anchor installation requirements
- Product substitution references (Parallam PSL, TJI joists, TimberStrand LSL)

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some nailing schedule values partially obscured by watermark diagonal
- Specific ASTM reference numbers in the anchor section (small text)
- Some dimensional values in the toe nail installation detail
- ICC-ESR report numbers partially obscured
- Exact grading agency abbreviations (WCLIB/WWPA) partially obscured by watermark
- Some specific code section references difficult to read at small scale
