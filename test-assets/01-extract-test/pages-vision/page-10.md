## Partial Foundation Plan (Left Half of Sheet)

**Scale:** 1/2" = 1'-0"

### Drawing Description
- Rectangular foundation plan showing continuous footings around the perimeter
- Overall dimensions: approximately 8'-0" x 12'-6" (exterior dimensions shown)
- 4" slab on grade with #4 rebar at 18" O.C. each way. See detail 1/S2.
- 15" wide FTG x 18" deep continuous footing (typical) with 2-#4 bars, see detail 1/S2
- Interior dimension annotation: 15'-4"
- Concrete landing per architect's plans (noted at entry/step area)
- Foundation corners detailed with continuous footing intersections
- Shear wall locations indicated with hatched symbols at specific wall segments

### Plan Notes - Foundation:

101. All foundation depths are into undisturbed soil.
102. Foundation bolts to be 5/8" with 7" embedment at 48" max, 12" max. dist. to all ends and sills. See detail 2/S2.
103. Type V cement with 2500 PSI concrete with water-cement ratio not to exceed 0.45. No special inspection required.
104. Use min. 7"x7"x3/2" washers.
105. Foundation sill plate to be preservative-treated wood.
106. Fasteners in contact with preservative-treated wood shall be hot dipped zinc-coated, galvanized stainless steel, silicon, bronze, or copper.
107. All (N) walls shall be connected to adjacent (E) concrete with drill & epoxy dowels (3/4" diameter) with Simpson Set 3C (ESR#4057). All such dowels shall have 8" min detail 7/S2.

## Partial Floor Framing Plan (Right Half of Sheet)

**Scale:** 1/2" = 1'-0"

### Drawing Description
- Floor framing plan showing joist layout over the foundation
- 2x6 @ R.B. (rim board) at 16" O.C. along perimeter
- Floor joists running horizontally across the plan
- 2x6 at 16" O.C. typical floor joists
- Ridge board / beam annotations: "8 RIDGE BD." noted
- 4x6 HDR. (header) elements shown at multiple locations (appears at least 4 locations)
- 2x6 blocking between joists at mid-span and supports
- Joist hangers and connections at bearing points
- Dimensions: 4x6 HDR. spans noted at several openings
- 2x6 BL (blocking) at 11" and other intervals
- Simpson hardware connections noted at critical intersections

### Plan Notes - Framing:

201. See detail 6/S2 for shearwall schedule.
202. Provide wall sheathing at all exterior shear walls as follows: Wood structural panel, 3/4" CD APA rated plywood or OSB sheathing, Exposure 1, span rating 32/16, nailed with 8d commons spaced at 6" O.C. along all panel edges (E.N.) and 12" O.C. along intermediate supports (field) (F.N.). No blocks required. See detail 1/S3.
203. All (N) headers (VDR) to be per 4x6 with trimmer stud U.N.O.
204. Provide floor sheathing as follows: Wood structural panel, 15/32" CD APA rated plywood or OSB sheathing, Exposure 1, span rating 32/16, nailed with 10d commons spaced at 6" O.C. along all panel edges (E.N.) and 12" O.C. along intermediate supports (field) (F.N.). No blocks required. See detail 1/S3.
205. Stud wall framing per 8/S3.

## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block (firm, address, sheet number, sheet title)
- Scale notations (1/2" = 1'-0" for both plans)
- Foundation notes 101-107 (clearly legible)
- Framing notes 201-205 (clearly legible)
- Symbols legend descriptions
- Member sizes (2x6, 4x6, etc.)
- Sheathing specifications in notes 202 and 204
- Nailing patterns and spacing requirements

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some interior dimensions on both plans obscured by watermark diagonal
- Exact joist spacing annotations in some areas difficult to read through watermark
- Some detail callout numbers (e.g., references to S2 and S3 details) partially obscured
- Connection hardware specifications at some intersections are small and hard to read
- Exact overall building dimensions partially obscured (8'-0" x 12'-6" approximate)
- Some blocking dimension annotations difficult to distinguish from joist annotations
- Note 107 end partially obscured by watermark -- "8" min detail 7/S2" is best reading
