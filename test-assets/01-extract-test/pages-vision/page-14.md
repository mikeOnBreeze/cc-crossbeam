## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information (Project, Address, Sheet Number, Firm, Date, Owner)
- Document type: Certificate of Compliance forms (CF-1R series) per 2022 California Energy Code
- Sheet layout: 6 compliance certificate forms arranged in a 2-row x 3-column grid
- Watermark text
- Climate Zone 8 designation
- Building Type: Single Family, New Construction

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- All six CF-1R forms contain detailed tabular data with small text that is significantly obscured by the large diagonal watermark
- Specific U-factors, R-values, SHGC values, and efficiency ratings within each table could not be reliably read
- Registration numbers for forms 2-6 are estimated based on typical CF-1R series numbering
- The compliance manager/software identification text at the bottom margin is too small to read reliably
- Individual cell values in the envelope, mechanical, and lighting compliance tables are not confidently extractable at this resolution with watermark overlay
- Part labels (Part A, Part B, etc.) within each form are inferred from standard CF-1R form structure

### Items That Could Not Be Read
- Specific numeric values in most table cells across all 6 forms
- Compliance software name and version
- Signature/certification fields
- Detailed footnotes within each form
- Exact registration numbers for each individual CF-1R certificate
