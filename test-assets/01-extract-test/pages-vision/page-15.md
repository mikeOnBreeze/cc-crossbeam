## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information (Project, Address, Sheet Number, Firm, Date, Owner)
- Overall document type: 2022 Single Family Residential Mandatory Requirements Summary per California Title 24, Part 6
- Sheet layout: 6 columns of text arranged in 2 rows of 3 columns
- Section headers and topic categories (Building Envelope, HVAC, Lighting, Plumbing, etc.)
- General subject matter of each numbered section
- Watermark text

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- The large diagonal watermark significantly obscures text throughout all 6 columns
- Specific code section references (e.g., Section 150.2(b)1H, ASHRAE 62.2) may have minor transcription errors
- Exact numeric values (R-values, AFUE percentages, CFM values, GPM flow rates) within the body text could not be reliably extracted at this resolution
- Some section numbers and their ordering may not be exactly as printed — the numbering sequence is estimated based on typical document flow
- Specific equipment efficiency thresholds and performance metrics mentioned in HVAC sections
- Detailed sub-requirements within each numbered section have been summarized rather than transcribed verbatim due to small text size and watermark interference
- The exact boundary between some sections is unclear where text runs together

### Items That Could Not Be Read
- Fine-print footnotes or reference notes at the bottom of each column
- Specific NFRC, ACCA, or ASHRAE reference numbers within body paragraphs
- Exact R-value, U-factor, and SHGC threshold numbers within sentences
- Any table or sub-table data that may exist within the columns (text too small to distinguish)
- Section sub-numbering (e.g., 150.1(c)14 type references embedded in text)
