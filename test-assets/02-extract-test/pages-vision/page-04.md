## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information (project, address, sheet number, firm names)
- Room labels and square footages
- Major structural callouts (ADU, garage, residence)
- Site plan legend and notes (partially obscured but largely readable)
- Property dimensions and setback notations

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some smaller dimension text is partially obscured by the diagonal watermark
- Fine detail dimensions between rooms/structures are difficult to read at 200 DPI
- Some of the site plan notes text (items 2-4) is partially covered by watermark — text reconstructed from visible portions
- Small annotations near mechanical equipment (heat pump specs) are partially obscured
