## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information (project name, address, sheet number, designer, job number, date)
- Demolition notes full text (clearly legible at top-left, above watermark)
- Demo legend symbols and descriptions
- Building square footage (1,854.0 SQ.FT.)
- Trellis demo area (378.0 SQ.FT.)
- Scale notation
- Designer contact information (Oscar Sanchez, phone, email)

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- The watermark heavily covers the center and lower portions of the roof plan drawing, making some roof ridge line details harder to trace
- Any smaller dimension annotations on the roof plan are not legible due to watermark overlay
- The revision description table content (if any) is obscured by the watermark in the lower-right area
- Firm address details for Ideal Designs partially obscured but reconstructed from visible text
