- Wall covering notes
- Plumbing fixture notes (mostly legible)
- Room layout and general floor plan arrangement

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Several window schedule entries (sizes, glazing types) partially obscured by watermark
- Electrical symbols legend is heavily affected by watermark; many symbol descriptions are reconstructed from partial visibility and context
- Typical kitchen electrical notes items 5-10 partially obscured
- Smoke & carbon monoxide alarm notes items 4-6 heavily obscured by watermark
- Clothes dryer exhaust ducting notes partially obscured
- Specific room dimensions on the floor plan are not legible due to watermark overlay and small text at 200 DPI
- Some door schedule details (frame sizes, material for entries 3-4) partially obscured
- Electrical layout specifics (exact outlet/switch positions) difficult to read through watermark
