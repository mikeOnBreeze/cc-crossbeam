## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Sheet number (A3) and title block information
- Elevation labels and scales
- Roof plan layout and solar panel placement
- Section labels (A and B)
- Watermark text
- Building dimensions (30'-6", 14'-6")
- R-15 insulation callouts

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some roofing material note text is partially obscured by the watermark
- Net free area ventilation table values are difficult to read at this resolution
- Some dimension strings on the elevations are small and partially obscured
- Capillary break detail annotations are very small and partially blocked by watermark
- Address note text is partially overlapped by watermark diagonal text
- Exact specification numbers in the roof assembly callouts are hard to confirm
