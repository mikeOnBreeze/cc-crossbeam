## Statement of Special Inspection (Top-Left Zone)

1. Continuous and periodic special inspection is required for the work as described in CBC as referenced in Table 1705.3. Special inspection shall be performed as required.
2. The special inspector does not have approval or failure to comply with the plans or specifications. Any item that fails to be clear or is ambiguous must be brought to the attention of the engineer.
3. Structural wood: Periodic special inspection is required for wood shear walls, wood shear wall diaphragms. This includes inspection of nailing connections, fastening of components of the seismic force resisting system, including wood shear walls, wood diaphragms, drag struts, shear panels, and hold-downs. Exception: Special inspection is not required for wood shear walls, shear panels and diaphragms including nails, bolts, anchoring and other fasteners where the specific spacing of the fasteners is 4 inches on center (O.C.) Inspections shall be per CBC.
4. Contractors responsible for construction of a wind or seismic force resisting system/component listed in this statement of special inspection shall submit a written statement of responsibility to the city inspectors and the owner prior to the commencement of work on such a system or component (per CBC, section...).
5. Provide deputy inspection for concrete, reinforcing steel, and epoxy dowels.

## Concrete (Top-Center Zone)

1. Concrete is permitted and placed as per approved/contract documents. Where reinforcement is not specifically shown or where details are not given, provide reinforcement similar to that shown for similar conditions, subject to review by the engineer of record.
2. All work pertaining to the concrete construction shall conform to the latest edition of ACI 318 "Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete" and ACI 301 (+/- 1/7 tolerances for tolerances for concrete construction and materials).
3. All structural concrete shall have a minimum compressive strength at 28 days and a max water/cement ratio as follows:

| Location | Strength | W/C | Type of Concrete |
|---|---|---|---|
| All Locations U.N.O. | 2,500 PSI | 0.65 | Normal wt. |
| — | — | — | The same as for other similar work |

4. Concrete mixes shall be prepared with Type V Portland Cement conforming to ASTM C-150.
5. Normal weight concrete aggregates shall conform to ASTM C33. Light weight concrete aggregates shall conform to ASTM C-330.
6. Water used in mixing concrete shall conform with ASTM C-1602.
7. Thoroughly clean and roughen all hardened concrete and masonry surfaces with which fresh concrete is to come in contact. Horizontal surfaces shall be roughened to a full amplitude of 1/4" unless noted otherwise.
8. Where dowels such as, but not limited to, connections, pins, and anchors, are to be placed into or thru concrete members, direct contact of such members to existing structures, and as needed to comply with code (i.e. California Plumbing Code), such elements, and as needed to comply with code provisions for attachment of such elements shall be specified by GE or obtained by GE from designer/specifier/architect/installer/ manufacturer as the case may be. GE shall determine alternative detailing as practically possible around the embedded elements.
9. Non-shrink cement grout shall have a minimum 28 day compressive strength of 7000 PSI. Use Quaker Lube G-15 or equal (1:1 Mix by Proportion).
10. Defective concrete (voids, rock pockets, honeycombing) shall be repaired and restored as directed by the engineer.

## Reinforcement (Center Zone)

1. All reinforcing bars shall conform to ASTM A-615, Grade 60, unless noted otherwise.
2. All smooth dowels: ASTM A36, Fy 36 KSI.
3. Rebar shall have the following concrete cover set as for per code:

| Condition | Cover |
|---|---|
| Poured against earth: | 3" |
| Concrete exposed to weather (#6 and larger): | 2" |
| Concrete exposed to weather (#5 and smaller): | 1-1/2" |
| Other concrete not exposed to weather: | 1-1/2" |

4. Bars shall be firmly supported and accurately placed as required by the ACI Standards. Laps, tie and support bars as needed to assure fly before/after placement. Provide dowels to match all requirements as per code, unless shown on noted otherwise. All dowels and splices per ACI 318.
5. All principal rebar shall terminate with a standard hook minimum unless specifically detailed otherwise. Rebar detail shall be made cold. Rebar shall not be offset with any portion of the bar as engaged in concrete.
6. All lap splices are Class 'B' lap splices unless noted otherwise.

## General (Top-Right Zone)

1. All new construction shall comply with the contract documents and the 2022 California Building Code.
2. Notes and details on the structural drawings take precedence over these standard practice notes. Structural notes do not apply to or supersede verification applied on drawings individually. If discrepancies exist, these shall be verified with the engineer of record.
3. The contractor shall determine the various elements to be erected or installed, staging work, and the engineering/architect shall be immediately notified of any discrepancies. Notes on structural drawings take precedence over these notes for details on structural drawings.
4. Verify in the field prior to installation the various elements identified on the plans that require shoring. The engineer of record shall be responsible for the design of the bracing and shoring system used during erection. The same as for other similar work.
5. Notes on structural plans shall take precedence in the area in question in lieu of these notes.
6. All materials shall conform to the requirements of the CBC 2022 or latest edition. All lumber, steel, and concrete connections must be reviewed and approved by the engineer of record prior to installation. Fresh concrete placement shall apply continuously and not separated in time.
7. Contractor shall contact engineer of record for review of any temporary bracing design or review proposed temporary construction of such elements to confirm consistency per contract documents. Contractor shall contact engineer for review of any temporary bracing.
8. Notify the owners engineer/designer if any buried structures not indicated (such as foundations, piping, etc.) are encountered during excavation.
9. Protect framing and standing water from proceeding rain/moisture prior to closing in framing.

### Additional General Notes (Right Zone, Lower)

13. All wood structures, footings, etc. which impinge upon new construction, unless otherwise specified, shall be removed.
14. The contractor is solely responsible for excavation procedures including underpinning, underpinning and protection of existing structures.
15. Locate and protect existing utilities to remain during and/or after construction.
16. Protect framing and standing water from proceeding rain/moisture prior to closing.
