3. Adhesive dowels: ASTM A-615 Grade 60 reinforcing steel.
4. All anchors shall be installed in accordance with ICC-ES report and COLA report and manufacturer's installation recommendations.
5. Unless otherwise noted, provide minimum embedment of anchors per ICC-ES report. COLA approved set anchor installation recommendations.
6. Prior to all drilling or coring, the contractor shall (1) verify the existing concrete or masonry thickness to prevent damage to the opposite face of concrete and rebar, (2) cut clean holes, and (3) remove existing debris/loose particles/oil/standing water at bottom of hole.
7. If reinforcement is encountered during drilling, abandon and shift the hole location as allowed per ICC-ES report. If reinforcement cannot be avoided or the hole location cannot be shifted, the contractor shall not cut, remove, or damage any reinforcement. Contractor to notify engineer. Grout voids between the dowels and the abandoned hole. Fill the abandoned hole with non-shrink grout. If alternative anchor locations cannot be resolved as noted above, the engineer will determine a new location.
8. All anchors shall be proof tested by overtress testing and inspection after installation. Test 10% of all anchors.
9. Test anchoring no sooner than 24 hours after installation.
10. Each test (only one) of an approved anchor shall experience full tension on the anchor such as direct pull with a hydraulic jack, torque wrench, or calibrated spring scale.
11. Adhesive anchors shall be installed in concrete or grout having a minimum age of 21 days at the time of anchor installation.

## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Sheet number (SN2) and firm (GSE Structural Engineering)
- Nailing schedule connections and nail sizes (main table)
- Mechanical and adhesive anchor specifications (Hilti HVU 2022, ASTM references)
- Structural wood lumber grades (Douglas Fir-Larch, No. 2, DFL #2)

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some nailing schedule values in the lower portion of the table are partially obscured by the watermark
- ESR report numbers and LARR numbers for engineered wood products are partially blocked
- Specific ICC-ES report numbers for adhesive anchors difficult to confirm
- Some dimensional specifications in the structural wood section are small text
- The secondary nailing schedule (Schedule B) in the lower-left is heavily obscured by watermark
- Firm address details in the title block right margin are partially blocked
- Simpson catalog references and specific model numbers for hold-down hardware are partially obscured
- Weyerhaeuser product grade numbers and ICC/LARR references at the bottom are difficult to read precisely
