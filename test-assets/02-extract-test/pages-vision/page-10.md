## Symbols Legend (Top-Center)
- Shaded rectangle: Indicates wood shear wall per shearwall schedule on S/S2 and sill bolt conn. per 2/S2
- Circle with dot: Indicates wood post and holdown, see 4/S2

## Partial Foundation Plan (Left Half)
**Scale:** 1/2" = 1'-0"

Drawing shows a rectangular foundation plan with the following features:
- Overall dimensions approximately 8'-0" x 12'-6" (partial view)
- 4" slab on grade with #4 rebar at 18" O.C. each way, see detail 1/S2
- 15" wide FTG x 18" deep continuous footing with 2-#4 bars, typical
- Concrete landing per architect's plans
- Foundation bolt locations indicated at corners and along walls

### Plan Notes - Foundation:
1. 101. All foundation depths are into undisturbed soil.
2. 102. Foundation bolts to be 5/8" W/ 7" embed @ 48" max, 12" max. dist. to all ends/sills. See detail 2/S2.
3. 103. Type V cement with 2500 PSI concrete w/ water-cement ratio not to exceed 0.45. No special inspection req'd.
4. 104. Use min. 7"x7"x2-1/2" washers.
5. 105. Foundation sill plate to be preservative-treated wood.
6. 106. Fasteners in contact with preservative-treated wood shall be hot dipped zinc-coated, galvanized steel, stainless steel, silicon, bronze, or copper.
7. 107. All (N) walls shall be connected to adjacent (E) concrete with drill & epoxy dowels @ 12" spacing W/ Simpson SET 3C (ESP#4507). All such dowels shall have 8" min. detail 7/S2.

## Partial Floor Framing Plan (Right Half)
**Scale:** 1/2" = 1'-0"

Drawing shows floor framing layout with:
- 2x6 @ R.B. at 16" O.C. (floor joists)
- Ridge board indicated at center
- 4x6 HDR. beams at multiple locations
- 2x6 blocking between joists
- 2x8 at 16" O.C. members
- 4x6 HDR. members spanning openings

### Plan Notes - Framing:
1. 201. See detail 5/S2 for shearwall schedule.
2. 202. Provide wall sheathing at all exterior shear walls as follows: Wood structural panel, 3/4" CD APA rated plywood or OSB sheathing, exposure 1, span rating 32/16, nailed with 8d common spaced at 4" O.C. along all panel edges (E.N.) and 12" O.C. along intermediate supports (field) (F.N.). Span rating 32/16, nailed with 8d common spaced at 6" O.C. along all panel edges.
3. 203. Provide floor sheathing as follows: Wood structural panel, 15/32" CD APA rated plywood or OSB sheathing, exposure 1, span rating 32/16, nailed with 10d common spaced at 6" O.C. along all panel edges (E.N.) and 12" O.C. along intermediate supports (field) (F.N.). No block req'd. See detail 1/S3.
4. 204. Stud wall framing per 8/S3.
5. 201. All (N) headers (VDS) to be 4x6 W/ trimmer stud U.N.O.

## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information (firm, address, sheet number)
- Foundation plan dimensions and notes 101-107
- Framing plan notes 201-204
- Scale notations
- Symbol legend content
- Member sizes (2x6, 4x6, 2x8)

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some dimensions on the foundation plan partially covered by watermark text
- Interior detail callout numbers on drawings partially obscured
- Exact spacing of some rebar callouts hard to read at edges
- Note 107 partially obscured by watermark — ESP number may be approximate
- Some framing member labels at center of drawing obscured by watermark diagonal
