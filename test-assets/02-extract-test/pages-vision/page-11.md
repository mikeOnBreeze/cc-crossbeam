## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information (firm, address, sheet number)
- Detail bubble numbers and general layout (1 through 8)
- Shearwall schedule structure and notes
- General construction methods shown in each detail
- Holdown notes text

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Shearwall schedule specific values — many cells obscured by watermark diagonal; exact holdown model numbers and uplift values not fully legible
- Holdown/column schedule values largely obscured
- Detail 5 and Detail 8 center content heavily covered by watermark
- Specific dimensions within detail sections (bolt embedment depths, spacing) partially obscured
- Some note numbers in the holdown notes section are difficult to read due to small text and watermark overlap
- Exact nail sizes and spacing in some detail callouts are at the limit of readability
