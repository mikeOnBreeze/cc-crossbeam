## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information (firm, address, sheet number)
- Detail bubble numbers and general layout (1 through 9, A, B)
- Header/opening framing sizes and trimmer requirements in Detail 7
- Hip roof framing layout description in Detail 1
- DTC clip detail and Simpson hardware references
- Perpendicular vs. parallel to joist blocking details (A and B)

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Detail 4 roof framing notes partially covered by watermark — specific clip model numbers and nailing schedules hard to confirm
- Detail 5 sheathing plan center content heavily obscured by watermark
- DTC clip spacing table values partially obscured — exact spacing numbers may not be fully accurate
- Some dimension callouts in Detail 8 (stud wall) are small and overlapped by watermark
- Specific nailing schedules (nail size and spacing) in several details are at the limit of legibility due to 200 DPI resolution and watermark interference
- Detail 4 balloon framing notes partially cut off or obscured
