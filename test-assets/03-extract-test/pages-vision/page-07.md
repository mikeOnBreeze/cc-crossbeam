## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Sheet number A3 and title clearly legible
- All four elevation labels (West, South, North, East) confirmed
- Roof plan with solar panel array clearly visible
- Wall assembly detail in capillary break section
- R-15 insulation callout in multiple locations
- Section labels A and B confirmed
- Equipment locations on North elevation (electric meter, water heater, A/C condenser)
- Net free area ventilation table structure visible

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Specific height dimensions partially obscured by watermark — "Study Set" text crosses several elevations
- Exact net free area calculation values partially obscured
- Some dimension strings at roof plan edges are small and partially illegible
- Ventilation table total value partially obscured by watermark
- Roof pitch rise:run ratio not clearly legible from elevations (appears to be approximately 4:12 or 5:12 but not confirmed)
- Building height from grade to peak dimension not clearly called out with a single definitive number
