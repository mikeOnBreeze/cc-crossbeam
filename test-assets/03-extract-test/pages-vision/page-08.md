## Statement of Special Inspection (Left Column, Top)

1. Continuous and periodic special inspection is required for the work as described in CBC Ch. 17 as represented as follows where required:

2. The special inspector does not have approval of failure to comply with plans or specifications. Any item that fails to be clear or is ambiguous must be clarified with the structural engineer.

3. Structural wood: Periodic special inspection is required for wood shear walls, wood shear wall diaphragms, wood shear panels, and components. Inspection of the fastening of components of the seismic force resisting system, including wood shear walls, wood diaphragms, drag struts, braces, shear panels, and holdowns. Exception: Special inspection is not required for wood shear walls, shear panels and diaphragms including nails, bolts, framing anchors, and other connectors where the specific spacing of the sheathing is more than 4 inches on center (O.C.). Inspections shall be continuous.

4. Contractors responsible for construction of a wind or seismic force resisting system/component listed in this statement of special inspection shall submit a written statement of responsibility to the city inspectors and the owner prior to the commencement of work on such a system or component (CBC 1705.3).

5. Provide daily inspection for concrete, reinforcing steel, and epoxy dowels.

## Concrete (Center Column, Top)

1. Concrete is determined and placed under continuous observation noted. Where reinforcing is not specifically shown or where details are not given, provide reinforcement similar to that shown for similar conditions, subject to review by the structural engineer.

2. All work of work pertaining to the concrete construction shall conform to the latest edition of ACI-318 "Building code requirements for reinforced concrete" and ACI-315.1(7) "Specifications for tolerances for concrete construction and materials."

3. All structural concrete shall have a minimum compressive strength at 28 days and a max water-cement ratio as follows:

| LOCATION | STRENGTH | W/C | TYPE OF CONCRETE |
|---|---|---|---|
| ALL LOCATIONS (N.D.) | **2,500 PSI** | **0.65** | NORMAL WT. |

4. Concrete mixes shall be prepared with Type V Portland Cement conforming to ASTM C-150.

5. Normal weight concrete aggregates shall conform to ASTM C33. Light weight concrete aggregates shall conform to ASTM C-330.

6. Water used in mixing concrete shall conform with ASTM C-1602.

7. Thoroughly clean and roughen all hardened concrete and masonry surfaces to be in contact with new concrete. All horizontal construction joints including (wall) surfaces shall be roughened to a full amplitude of 1/4".

8. Where dowels such as, but not limited to, connections, pins, or anchor bolts, are to be placed into or thru concrete members, direct contact of such members with such elements and as needed to comply with CBC & California plumbing code. Exact location and size of any sleeves, inserts, or blockouts through structural elements shall be specified by GE. Opening dimensions/specifications shall be approved as practical — they shall be as small as practically possible around the embedded elements.

9. Non-shrink cement grout shall have a minimum 28 day compressive strength of 7000 PSI. Use Quaker's Aker Lab Non-Shrink Grout, Sika 212, or approved equal. Revised as directed by the structural engineer.

## Reinforcement (Center Column, Bottom)

1. All reinforcing bars shall conform to ASTM A-615, Grade 60, unless noted otherwise.

2. All smooth dowels: ASTM A-36, 36 KSI.

3. Rebar shall have the following concrete cover set as per ACI:

| CONDITION | COVER |
|---|---|
| FOOTINGS AGAINST EARTH | 3" |
| CONCRETE EXPOSED TO WEATHER (#6 AND LARGER) | 2" |
| CONCRETE EXPOSED TO WEATHER (#5 AND SMALLER) | 1-1/2" |
| ALL OTHER CONDITIONS | 3/4" |
| CONCRETE NOT EXPOSED TO WEATHER | 1-1/2" |
| OTHER CONCRETE NOT EXPOSED TO WEATHER | 1-1/2" - 1-1/2" |

4. Bars shall be firmly supported and accurately placed as required by the ACI standards. Lend tie and support bars as needed to assure reinforcement in position where necessary for firm and accurate placing. Provide dowels to match all reinforcement at floor. Unless shown on plans, noted otherwise — all dowels and splices shall be per ACI.

5. All principal rebars shall terminate with a standard hook, minimum unless specifically detailed otherwise. Rebar shall be made cold. Rebar shall not be heated at any point if the bar is engaged in concrete.

6. All lap splices are Class 'B' lap splices unless noted otherwise.

## General (Right Column)

1. All new construction shall comply with the contract documents and the 2022 California building code.

2. Notes and details on the structural drawings take precedence over these standard practice notes. Details noted as typical (TYP.) be used whenever applicable. If there is any inconsistency or discrepancy between the structural drawings, standard work, and the engineer/architect shall be immediately notified.

3. The contractor is responsible for the various elements of a structural nature. The structural engineer shall be requested to review all changes to the structural drawings prior to any changes being made.

4. Notes are applicable to all areas in the work that are in or thru slabs, beams, or walls as noted on the structural drawings.

5. Materials as specified shall conform to the requirements of the CBC 22 and the ASTM. All material and workmanship shall be of the highest standard.

6. All materials and apparatus shall conform to the requirements of the 2022 CBC. Materials and placement shall apply continuously and to all temporary structures.

7. Registered/responsible civil engineer to design all temporary structures required for the construction purpose until approval.

8. Contractor shall contact engineer if excavation reveal unfavorable conditions or subsurface or a soils engineer member location per the structural plan.

9. All footings shall require a min 12" top of the current adjacent grade and a minimum of 12" and native soil. Wherever ground level is sloped away.

10. Excavation shall be properly backfilled. All fill shall be compacted to a minimum of 90% relative compaction.

11. Where ground footings, utilities, etc. which require new construction, unless otherwise noted:

12. All openings in soil-bearing — responsible excavation procedures including underpinning, underrunning and protection of existing structures.

13. Locate and protect existing utilities to remain during and/or after construction.

14. Protect floor slabs and standing water from proceeding into excavation prior to placing concrete.

15. Notify the owners representative if any buried structures not indicated, such as underground tanks, vaults, etc. are encountered during excavation.
