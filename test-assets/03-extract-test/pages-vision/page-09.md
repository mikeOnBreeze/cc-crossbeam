## Mechanical and Adhesive Anchors (Center Column)

1. Adhesive anchors and dowels installed into concrete: A 707.51 SD. per drawings shown in the drawings.

2. By HIT-HY 200 BY HILTI, CC2A PARASEAL 550400.

3. Adhesive anchors: ASTM A-32 threaded rods with ASTM A 563 Grade A nuts and ASTM F844 2.5 "t" washers, unless otherwise noted. Anchors designated as ASTM A-193 Grade B7 threaded rods to use ASTM A 563 Grade C HH nuts and ASTM F436 washers.

4. Adhesive dowels: ASTM A-615 Grade 60 reinforcing steel.

5. All anchors shall be installed in accordance with ICC-ES report and COLA report and manufacturer's recommendations.

6. Unless otherwise noted, provide minimum embedment of anchors per ICC-ES report. Cola report, and manufacturer's recommendations.

7. Prior to all drilling or coring, the contractor shall: (1) verify the existing concrete or masonry thickness to prevent damage to the opposite face of concrete and masonry; (2) cut core holes, and (3) demolish existing reinforcement location of placement.

8. If reinforcement is encountered during drilling, abandon and shift the hole location as allowed per ICC report and engineer's specification. If the hole does not intersect rebar, or sound concrete between the dowel and the abandoned hole, fill the abandoned hole with adhesive. If the hole is shifted beyond what is allowed as noted above, the engineer will determine a new location.

9. All anchors shall be proof tested by domestic testing and inspection. Test 10% of all anchors.

10. Test anchors no sooner than 24 hours after installation.

11. First entry (head) for any adhesive that shall experience the tension on the anchors, such as direct pull with a hydraulic jack, torque wrench, or calibrated spring-loaded devices.

12. Adhesive anchors shall be installed in concrete or grout having a minimum age of seven (7) days at the time of anchor installation.
