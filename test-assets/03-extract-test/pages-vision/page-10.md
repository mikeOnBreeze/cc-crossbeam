## Title Block (Right Edge, Vertical)
- **Project:** New Detached ADU
- **Address:** 1232 N. Jefferson St., Placentia, CA 92870
- **Sheet Number:** S1
- **Sheet Title:** Partial Foundation and Framing Plans
- **Firm:** GSE - Gonzalez Structural Engineering (661-209-1446)

## Symbols Legend (Top-Center)
- Hatched rectangle: Indicates wood shear wall per shearwall schedule on S/S2 and sill bolt conn. per 2/S2
- Filled circle with post: Indicates wood post and holdown, see 4/S2

## Partial Foundation Plan (Left-Half)
- **Scale:** 1/2" = 1'-0"
- Foundation outline is rectangular
- Dimensions: approximately 8'-0" x 12'-6" visible segments along edges
- 4" slab on grade with #4 rebar at 16" O.C. each way, see detail 1/S2
- 15" wide I.T.G. x 18" deep continuous footing with #4 rebar, 2-#4 bars, typical
- Concrete landing per architectural drawings noted at entry

### Plan Notes - Foundation
1. All foundation depths are into undisturbed soil
2. Foundation bolts to be 5/8" W/ 7" embedment at 48" max, 12" max. dist. to all ends/sills. See detail 2/S2
3. Type V cement with 2500 PSI concrete W/ water-cement ratio not to exceed 0.45. No special inspection required
4. Use minimum #4 x 7/0 x 2/0 chairs
5. Foundation sill plate to be preservative-treated wood
6. Fasteners in contact with preservative-treated wood shall be hot dipped zinc-coated, galvanized stainless steel, silicon, bronze, or copper
7. All (N) walls shall be connected to adjacent (E) concrete with drill & epoxy dowels to develop strength W/ Simpson SET SC (ESR#4057). All such dowels shall have 8" minimum detail 7/S2

## Partial Floor Framing Plan (Right-Half)
- **Scale:** 1/2" = 1'-0"
- 2x6 @ R.B. at 16" O.C. floor joists shown
- Shearwall locations marked with hatched symbols at perimeter walls
- 4x6 HDR. (headers) shown at multiple openings
- 2x6 BLK at 11" ridge blocking noted
- 2x8 @ 16" O.C. floor framing in body of plan

### Plan Notes - Framing
201. See detail 6/S2 for shearwall schedule
202. Provide wall sheathing at all exterior shear walls as follows: wood structural panel, 3/4" CD APA rated plywood or OSB sheathing, exposure 1, span rating 32/16, nailed with 8d common nails spaced at 4" O.C. along all panel edges (E.N.) and 12" O.C. along intermediate supports (field) (F.N.)
203. All (N) headers (HDR) to be 4x6 W/ trimmer stud U.N.O.
203. Provide floor sheathing as follows: wood structural panel, 15/32" CD APA rated plywood or OSB sheathing, exposure 1, span rating 32/16, nailed with 10d common nails spaced at 6" O.C. along all panel edges (E.N.) and 12" O.C. along intermediate supports (field) (F.N.). No blocking required. See detail 1/S3.
204. Stud wall framing per 8/S3.

## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information clearly legible
- Foundation notes 101-107 largely readable
- Framing notes 201-204 readable
- Slab specification (4" slab on grade, #4 rebar at 16" O.C.)
- Footing dimensions (15" wide x 18" deep)
- Foundation bolt spec (5/8" W/ 7" embedment at 48" max)
- Concrete spec (2500 PSI, Type V cement, W/C ratio max 0.45)
- Floor joist sizing (2x6 @ 16" O.C., 2x8 @ 16" O.C.)
- Header sizing (4x6 HDR)
- Sheathing specs for walls (3/4" CD, 32/16, 8d at 4"/12") and floor (15/32" CD, 32/16, 10d at 6"/12")

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some dimension strings partially obscured by watermark text
- Note 107 epoxy dowel detail partially covered by watermark; 8" minimum embedment inferred
- Exact overall building dimensions difficult to read due to watermark overlay
- Use of #4 rebar bar size and 7/0 x 2/0 chairs in note 104 partially obscured
