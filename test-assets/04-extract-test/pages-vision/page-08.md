## Statement of Special Inspection (Left Column)

1. Continuous and periodic special inspection is required for the work as described in CBC as required per IBC governing code requirements.
2. If the special inspector does not know the meaning of, failure to comply with, or is ambiguous about plans or specifications, any item that fails to be clear or is ambiguous must be referred to the architect/engineer of record for clarification prior to proceeding.
3. Structural wood: Periodic special inspection is required for wood shear walls, wood shear wall diaphragms, structural wood framing, including inspection of the fastening of components of the seismic force resisting system, including wood shear walls, wood diaphragms, struts, bracing, shear panels, and holdowns. Exception: special inspection is not required for wood shear walls, shear panels and diaphragms, including nails, bolting, anchoring and other fastening methods to other structural elements when the spacing is more than 4 inches on center (O.C.). Inspections shall be continuous.
4. Contractors responsible for construction of a wind or seismic force resisting system/component listed in this statement of special inspection shall submit a written statement of responsibility to the city inspectors and the owner prior to the commencement of work on such a system or component (CBC 1705.3).
5. Provide daily inspection for concrete, reinforcing steel, and epoxy dowels.

## Concrete (Center Column)

1. Concrete is dimensioned and placed as specified otherwise noted. Where reinforcing is not specifically shown or where details are not given, provide reinforcing similar to that shown for similar conditions, subject to review by the structural engineer.
2. All work of work pertaining to the concrete construction shall conform to the latest edition of ACI 318 "Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete" and ACI standard of +/- 1/2" tolerance for tolerances for concrete construction and floor.
3. All structural concrete shall have a minimum compressive strength at 28 days and a max water/cement ratio as follows:

| Location | Strength | W/C | Type of Concrete |
|----------|----------|-----|-----------------|
| All Locations (V.I.D.) | **2,500 PSI** | **0.65** | Normal |
| Alternate | **3,000 PSI** | **0.45** | Moderate |

4. Concrete mixes shall be prepared with Type V Portland cement conforming to ASTM C150.
5. Normal weight concrete aggregates shall conform to ASTM C33. Light weight concrete aggregates shall conform to ASTM C330.
6. Water used in mixing concrete shall conform with ASTM C1602.
7. Thoroughly clean and roughen all hardened concrete and masonry surfaces in contact with fresh concrete. All surfaces shall be roughened to a full amplitude of 1/4".
8. Where dowels such as, but not limited to, connections, pins, or other anchors are to be placed into or through concrete members, exact contact of such members of embedded elements, and as needed to comply with OSHA & California plumbing code through such elements, and as needed to comply with DSA & California plumbing code shall be specified by or obtained by GC from designer/architect/engineer/project manager and installed per the manufacturer's recommendations and as close as practically possible around the embedded elements.
9. Non-shrink cement grout shall have a minimum 28 day compressive strength of 7000 PSI. Use quantity (area) LB/FT mass (ASTM C1107).
10. Defective concrete (voids, rock pockets, cracks) shall be repaired and reinforced as directed by the structural engineer.

## Reinforcement (Center Column, Lower)

1. All reinforcing bars shall conform to ASTM A-615, Grade 60, unless noted otherwise.
2. All smooth dowels: ASTM A36 KS
3. Rebar shall have the following concrete cover set as per code:

| Exposure | Cover |
|----------|-------|
| Poured against earth | 3" |
| Concrete exposed to weather (4&5 and larger) | 2" |
| Concrete exposed to weather (#4 and smaller) | 1-1/2" |
| Not exposed to weather (slabs, walls) | 3/4" |
| Other concrete not exposed to weather | 1-1/2" |

4. Bars shall be firmly supported and accurately placed as required by the ACI standards. Using tie and support bars as noted in Appendix A. Design strength, where necessary for firm and accurate placing, provide dowels to match all requirements at poor, unless specifically noted otherwise. All dowels and lap splices at the base of columns shall be maintained as indicated.
5. All principal rebar shall terminate with a standard hook minimum unless specifically detailed otherwise. Rebar detail shall be made cold. Rebar shall not be offset with any portion of the bar is engaged in concrete.

## General (Right Column)

1. All new construction shall comply with the contract documents and the 2022 California Building Code.
2. Notes and details on the structural drawings take precedence over these standard notes. Structural notes (details) and typical or general sections applicable, except that in the event of conflicting requirements, the more restrictive provision shall apply. It is the responsibility of the contractor to review the various elements and bring any discrepancies to the attention of the engineer. If the engineer does not respond, the contractor shall follow the more restrictive standard work, and the engineer/architect shall be immediately notified. It is the responsibility of the structural engineer to resolve the various elements and design that the standard notes do not always cover all situations. The contractor shall follow the same as for other similar work.
3. Notes and details shown on the structural drawings are supplementary to the various elements. If in doubt, always use the larger of or the more restrictive.
4. All materials (structural) shall conform to the requirements of the 2022 CBC. All materials to be new, unless approved by the structural engineer. Storage of material shall apply continuously and not at temporary site.
5. Required: responsible structural civil engineer to design all temporary site support, shoring, underpinning, and any protection for adjacent/adjoining properties.
6. Contractor shall contact engineer if deviations from engineering conditions are discovered: a solid/dirt ledger anchor locations use the closer amount of grade (and a minimum of 1.0") and follow all manufacturer's guidelines and tested specifications.
7. All footings shall be placed on a new 12" layer of the current accepted grade and a minimum of 1.0" and follow soil manufacturer guidelines using tested specifications.
8. Excavation shall be properly backfilled, and fill shall be compacted to a minimum of 90% relative compaction.
9. Provide adequate footings, retainers, etc. which permit new construction, unless otherwise permitted.
10. All openings in masonry or concrete: reference applicable procedures including underpinning, underpinning and protection of existing structures.
11. Locate and protect existing utilities to remain during and/or after construction.
12. Provide bracing and standing water from excavations/trenching prior to placing concrete.
13. Notify the owner's representative if any buried structures not indicated, such as footings, slabs, drains, etc., are encountered during construction.
