## Toe Nail Installation Detail (Left Column, Below Schedule)
- Diagram showing proper toe nail installation
- Scale: N.T.S.
- Shows angle and placement of toe nail into joist/stud connection
- Labeled diagram with "A" callout

## Mechanical and Adhesive Anchors (Center Column)

1. Adhesive anchors and dowels installed into concrete: A. Test 10% (of drilled) across the entire structure. B. Per HY 200 or shall be COLA manufacturer's standard.
2. Adhesive anchors: ASTM A-325 threaded rods with ASTM A 563 Grade A nuts and ASTM F-436-3 flat washers, unless otherwise noted. Anchors designated as ASTM A-193 Grade B7 threaded rods (or ASTM A-325 Grade A rods) to be and with Grade 8 nuts and heavy flat washers.
3. Adhesive dowels: ASTM A-615 Grade 60 reinforcing steel.
4. All anchors shall be installed in accordance with ICC-ES report and COLA report and manufacturer's recommendations.
5. Unless otherwise noted, provide minimum embedment of anchors per ICC-ES report. Comply with manufacturer's installation recommendations.
6. Prior to all drilling or coring, the contractor shall (1) verify the existing concrete or masonry thickness to prevent damage to the opposite face of concrete and reinforcing; (2) cut cores (slots, etc.); and (3) obtain written approval from structural engineer for location of reinforcement, prior to installation.
7. If reinforcement is encountered during drilling, abandon and shift the hole location as allowed per manufacturer's recommendations. Prior to grouting, remove all dust, water, oil, loose or sound concrete between the dowel and the abandoned hole, fill the void with epoxy or approved concrete patching material. If an excessive number of holes as noted above, the engineer will determine a new location.
8. All anchors shall be proof tested by direct tensile testing and inspection testing. Test 10% of all anchors.
9. Test anchors no sooner than 24 hours after installation.
10. Each test load or non-representative sample shall experience the tension on the anchor such as direct pull with a hydraulic jack, torque wrench, or calibrated spring-loaded device = 1.107.
11. Adhesive anchors shall be installed in concrete or grout having a minimum (cured 28 days at the time of anchor installation).
