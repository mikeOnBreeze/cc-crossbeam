## Foundation Plan Notes (Bottom-Left, Below Plan)
**PLAN NOTES - FOUNDATION:**
1. 101. All foundation depths are into undisturbed soil.
2. 102. Foundation bolts to be 5/8" w/ 7" embedment @ 48" max, 12" max. dist. to all ends/sills. See Detail 2/S2.
3. 103. Type V cement w/ 2500 PSI concrete w/ water-cement ratio not to exceed 0.45. No special inspection req'd.

  - **Floor joists:** 2x6 @ 16" O.C. (running parallel, left-to-right)
  - **Rim/blocking:** noted at perimeter
  - **Headers at openings:** 4x6 HDR. (shown at multiple locations — at least 4 openings)
  - **Wall framing:** 2x6 at 16" O.C. typical wall framing visible
  - Shear wall symbols and holdown symbols at locations matching foundation plan

## Floor Framing Plan Notes (Bottom-Right, Below Plan)
**PLAN NOTES - FRAMING:**
1. 201. See Detail 6/S2 for shearwall schedule.
2. 202. Provide wall sheathing at all exterior shear walls as follows: Wood structural panel, 3/4" CD APA rated plywood or OSB sheathing, Exposure 1, span rating 32/16, nailed with 8d common spaced at 4" O.C. along all panel edges (E.N.) and 12" O.C. along intermediate supports (field) (F.N.).
3. 203. All (N) headers (HDR) to be 4x6 w/ trimmer stud U.N.O.
4. 203. Provide floor sheathing as follows: Wood structural panel, 15/32" CD APA rated plywood or OSB sheathing, Exposure 1, span rating 32/16, nailed with 10d common spaced at 6" O.C. along all panel edges (E.N.) and 12" O.C. along intermediate supports (field) (F.N.). No block req'd. See Detail 1/S3.
5. 204. Stud wall framing per 8/S3.

## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information (firm, address, sheet number)
- Foundation notes 101-107 (clearly legible)
- Framing notes 201-204 (clearly legible)
- Concrete spec: 2500 PSI, Type V cement, W/C ratio 0.45 max
- Foundation bolt spec: 5/8" diameter, 7" embedment, 48" max spacing, 12" max to ends
- Footing dimension: 15" wide x 18" deep continuous footing with 2-#4 T&B
- Slab spec: 4" slab with #4 @ 16" O.C. each way
- Wall sheathing: 3/4" CD APA, 32/16 span rating, 8d common nails @ 4" edge / 12" field
- Floor sheathing: 15/32" CD APA, 32/16 span rating, 10d common nails @ 6" edge / 12" field
- Headers: 4x6 with trimmer stud
- Epoxy dowels: 1/2" diameter, Simpson Set 3C (ESR#4057), 8" min embedment
- Symbols legend content

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some dimensions on the foundation plan are partially obscured by the watermark
- Exact count of holdown and shear wall symbol locations difficult to confirm due to watermark overlap
- Joist callout at top-right of framing plan partially obscured — appears to be 3x6 @ R.B. but may be different member size
- Some intermediate dimensions on foundation plan edges partially blocked
