## Overview

This sheet contains 6 tiled pages of the 2022 Single-Family Residential Mandatory Requirements Summary. This is a comprehensive checklist of California Title 24 mandatory measures that must be met regardless of compliance method (performance or prescriptive). The text is dense, small, and structured as numbered sections with subsections. Pages are identified as MR01 through MR06 (or similar sequential pagination).

## Mandatory Requirements Page 1 (Top-Left)

**Title:** 2022 Single-Family Residential Mandatory Requirements Summary

**Sections covered (partially legible):**
1. **Air Leakage** — Building envelope air sealing requirements; caulking and weather-stripping at joints, penetrations; air barrier requirements; visual inspection of framing stage sealing
2. **Below-Grade Vapor Retarder** — Moisture control requirements for slab-on-grade; vapor retarder specification under concrete slabs
3. **Insulation and Installation** — Requirements for correct insulation installation quality; HERS verification of insulation installation; Grade I insulation requirement
4. **Insulation Certification by Manufacturers** — Insulation must be certified by Department of Consumer Affairs; Bureau of Household Goods labels; ASTM testing requirements
5. **Fenestration Products** — Window and glazing certification requirements; NFRC labels; U-factor and SHGC compliance with standards; temporary labels must remain until final inspection
6. **Roof Deck, Ceiling, and Attic Floor Specifications** — Radiant barrier requirements; cool roof requirements for Climate Zone 8; minimum reflectance and thermal emittance values

## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Sheet identification as T-3 (Mandatory Requirements Summary)
- Title block information (project, address, firm, date)
- Document type: 2022 Single-Family Residential Mandatory Requirements Summary
- 6 tiled pages of the mandatory requirements checklist are present
- Major section headings identifiable (air leakage, insulation, fenestration, HVAC, duct sealing, water heating, solar ready, battery storage ready, PV systems)
- Climate Zone 8 referenced in cool roof / radiant barrier requirements
- This is the 2022 code cycle edition

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Individual subsection text and specific requirements (very small text at composited scale)
- Specific numeric values (R-values, flow rates, efficiency minimums) embedded in body text
- Checkbox completion status for individual items (not visible at this resolution)
- Whether specific line items are checked as "compliant" vs "N/A" vs unchecked
- Specific CFM values for ventilation fans
- PV system minimum size requirement for this project
- Battery storage specific provisions
- Many body text paragraphs are too small to read reliably even without watermark
