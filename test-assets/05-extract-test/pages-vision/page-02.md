- Effective: 04-01-2011, Revised: 06-30-2017

### General Best Management Practices
- **BMP: Scheduling** — Purpose: To reduce the discharge of pollutants from construction site by sequencing the construction project to reduce the amount and duration of soil exposure
  - Schedule heavy grading projects during dry months
  - Cover and stabilize open cuts as quickly as possible
  - Schedule projects to disturb only small portions of the site at any one time
  - Cover all stabilize open cuts as quickly as possible

- **BMP: Preservation of Existing Vegetation**
  - Purpose: To reduce the discharge of pollutants from construction sites by using control measures to prevent erosion
  - Discourage existing vegetation on site
  - Identify areas that need protection, and protect them when practical
  - Make sure brush cut meets guidelines so cut-off does not enter storm drains

- **CASE: Material Delivery and Storage**
  - Purpose: To reduce the discharge of pollutants during the delivery and storage process by minimizing the storage of hazardous materials on site
  - Minimize on-site storage of hazardous materials
  - Prevent spills or leakage of liquid materials from contaminating soil or soaking into the ground
  - Be aware of potential pollutants that could be carried from construction projects through runoff
  - Provide curbs or dikes around the perimeter of material storage areas
  - Provide secondary containment for liquid hazardous materials
  - Keep hazardous materials in their original containers and keep them well labeled
  - Protect all materials from rain and vandalism...
  - Contain and clean up any spill immediately

- **CASE: Hazardous Waste Management**
  - Purpose: To reduce the discharge of pollutants by the proper storage and disposal of waste
  - Collect site waste regularly, daily during rainy and windy conditions
  - Properly dispose of all waste materials on a regular basis at other designated locations
  - Make sure that toxic wastes and chemicals are not disposed of in stormwater drains...

- **ESCO: Silt Fence** — select fence that retains 60% of flow...
- **ESCO: Sand Bag Barrier** — reduce discharge from construction by stabilizing sand bags along a linear path to prevent stormwater runoff...
- **ESCO: Sediment Basin** — retain pollutants from construction sites by retaining runoff sufficiently to allow sediment to settle out
- **ESCO: Stabilized Construction Entrance** — reduce discharge from construction sites by reducing the amount of sediment, dust, and mud tracked off-site from construction traffic

  - Purpose: Reduce discharge of pollutants as a result of the creation, stockpiling, and removal of solid construction debris
  - Collect site waste regularly, daily during rainy and windy conditions
  - Designate areas on-site for proper waste collection
  - Make sure that toxic wastes and chemicals are not disposed of in stormwater drainage channels

- **CASE: Hazardous Waste Management**
  - Proper storage and disposal of wastes
  - Ensure that substances are properly handled
  - Remove from site as quickly as possible
  - Dispose of hazardous waste containers at appropriate containers and under cover
  - Use impervious material under waste containers
  - Place hazardous waste containers in secondary containment
  - Recycle and reuse whenever possible
  - Maintain records of hazardous waste transported from site for acceptance designed for construction debris
