## New Attic Area Ventilation Calculation (Top-Right Area)
- **New Attic ADU:**
  - 2:1 ratio: 475.0/150 = 3.17 S.F. OF NET FREE VENTILATION
  - New Attic area calc: 475.0 S.F.
- **Proposed Vents:**
  - 4 — DORMER VENTS 24"x12" (1060 S.I. NET FREE PER VENT) = 400.00 S.I.
  - 2 — GABLE VENTS CA. G.A.L. (2160 S.I. NET FREE PER VENT) = 140.00 S.I.
- **TOTAL (N) NET FREE VENTILATION:** 540.00 S.I.

### Attic Vent Requirements (Notes 1-6)
1. A. Openings shall be placed so as to provide cross ventilation of the attic space
2. B. Opening size shall not be less than 1/150 of the attic area
3. C. Openings shall have corrosion-resistant wire mesh or other approved material with 1/16" minimum and 1/4" maximum opening
4. D. Size of the required ventilation area must be located at least 3-ft above eave or cornice vents
5. E. Where the ratio of 1/300 is used to vent the attic, not less than 50 percent and not more than 80 percent of the vents shall be located not more than 3-ft from roof line
6. F. All fire rated soffit to avoid no vent per code — see details on A5.1. Especially in all projections within 5-ft from any E.

## New Ceiling/Floor Area Ventilation Calc (Center-Right)
- Vent Area Calc: 3,360.0/150 = 2,533 S.F.
- **Proposed Vents:**
  - 9 — FLOOR VENT 14"x4" = 416.00 S.I.
  - (0.51 S.I. NET FREE PER VENT)
- **TOTAL (N) NET FREE VENTILATION:** 416.00 S.I.
- **NOTE: CEILING/FLOOR VENTILATION REQUIRED FOR METHANE MEASURES**

## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- All four elevation views clearly labeled with scales
- Attic ventilation calculations (both new attic and ceiling/floor) clearly legible
- Roofing material specification
- Title block information
- Roof plan layout and orientation
- Metal guardrailing detail
- Ventilation vent counts and sizes
- APPROVED stamp details

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some smaller dimension callouts on elevations are difficult to read precisely at this resolution
- MEC setback detail text in far-right column is small and partially obscured
- Exact building height dimension (grade to peak) is shown but hard to read precisely — appears to be approximately 22-24 feet total
- Some of the cantilever dimensions and stucco callout specifics are at the edge of legibility
- Purlins specification text in roof plan area is small
