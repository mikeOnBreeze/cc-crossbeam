## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Sheet identification as A5.1 Sections & Details
- Two main cross-sections (A and B) clearly visible
- Stairway guard railing requirements and handrail specifications
- 1-HR fire rated exterior wall detail clearly labeled
- Fire rated ceiling/floor assembly detail present
- Sound transmission requirements section present
- APPROVED stamp visible
- Staircase handrail dimensional requirements (34"-38" height, diameter specs)

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Specific wall assembly layer materials and thicknesses in sections A and B are difficult to read at this resolution
- Sound transmission STC/IIC rating values are small text and hard to read precisely
- Fire-rated assembly specific material callouts (GWB type, thickness layers) are partially obscured
- Some dimension callouts in the section views are too small to read with confidence
- The wall mounted shower detail text is very small
- R-value callouts in wall sections, if present, are not clearly legible
