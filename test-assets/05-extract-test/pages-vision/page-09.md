## 2022 CBC TABLE NO. 2304.10.2 — Fastening Schedule (Left Column)

Dense nailing schedule table with two parts spanning the left portion of the sheet.

### Fastening Schedule (Part 1 — Left)
Table format with columns for: Connection Description, Fastener Type, Number/Spacing

Key entries include (representative, not exhaustive — table contains approximately 40+ line items):

| Connection | Fastener | Spacing/Count |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Joist to sill or girder, toenail | 3-8d | Each joist |
| Bridging to joist, toenail each end | 2-8d | Each end |
| 1x6 subfloor or less to each joist, face nail | 2-8d | Each joist |
| 2" subfloor to joist or girder, blind and face nail | 2-16d | Each joist |
| Sole plate to joist or blocking, face nail | 16d @ 16" o.c. | Along plate |
| Top plate to stud, end nail | 2-16d | Each stud |
| Stud to sole plate, toenail | 4-8d or 3-16d | Each stud |
| Double studs, face nail | 16d @ 24" o.c. | Along stud |
| Double top plates, face nail | 16d @ 16" o.c. | Along plate |
| Double top plates, minimum lap splice | 16d @ 16" o.c. | — |
| Blocking between joists over bearing, toenail | 3-8d | Each block |
| Rim joist to top plate, toenail | 8d @ 6" o.c. | Along plate |
| Top plates, laps at corners | 2-16d | Each lap |
| Continuous header, two pieces, each edge | 16d @ 16" o.c. | Along edge |
| Ceiling joists to plate, toenail | 3-8d | Each joist |
| Ceiling joists, laps over partitions | 4-16d minimum | Each lap |
| Ceiling joist to parallel rafters, face nail | 3-16d minimum | Each rafter |
| Rafter to plate, toenail | 3-8d | Each rafter |
| Built-up corner studs | 16d @ 24" o.c. | Along stud |
| Built-up girders and beams | 16d @ 32" o.c. | Each edge |
| Wall sheathing (up to 1/2") | 6d | Per schedule |
| Wall sheathing (over 1/2") | 8d | Per schedule |
| Roof sheathing (up to 3/4") | 8d | Per schedule |

## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Sheet identification as S1.0 Structural Notes by Ramirez (Jose Ramirez, PE)
- Fastening schedule is clearly from 2022 CBC Table 2304.10.2
- Major section headings clearly legible: Concrete, Foundation, Design Criteria, Structural Wood, Rebar, General Notes
- Title block information (project number 61-097, date 9/9/23)
- Structural engineer identification: Jose Ramirez, PE (RAMIREZ firm)
- APPROVED stamp present

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Individual line items within the fastening schedule table are very dense and small — representative entries extracted but many rows are at the limit of legibility
- Specific concrete PSI values and cement type in the Concrete section are small text
- Exact seismic design values (Ss, S1, SDS, SD1) in Design Criteria section are not legible at this resolution
- Wind speed and exposure category values in Design Criteria are not clearly readable
- Rebar cover dimensions and specific lap splice lengths are too small to read with confidence
- General Notes individual item text is very dense and most items cannot be read word-for-word
- Lumber grade specifications beyond "DFL #2" are difficult to confirm
- Special inspection list items are not individually legible
