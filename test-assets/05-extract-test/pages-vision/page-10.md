- Structural steel specification values are small text
- Declaration and Design Assumptions text is dense and partially small
- Development Services form text at bottom is very small
- Special inspection required section details are at the limit of legibility
- Some abbreviation entries may be missed due to small font size
- Exact date on APPROVED stamp partially obscured
