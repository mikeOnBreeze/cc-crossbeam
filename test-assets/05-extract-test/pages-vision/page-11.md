## Plan Notes (Top-Left)

Numbered plan notes list (at least 12 items):

1. Refer to structural notes on sheet S1.0 and typical details on sheets S3.0-S3.1. These notes shall be used where applicable whether specifically referenced on plans or not.
2. Contractor shall coordinate the work of all trades with structural requirements, refer to architectural, civil, mechanical, plumbing and electrical drawings.
3. All dimensions are to face of studs unless noted otherwise.
4. Non-structural elements in nature such as drains, sumps, exterior hardscape, mechanical units, etc., are to be designed by others.
5. Structural walls are walls that resist gravity, wind, and/or seismic loads. All exterior wood framed walls are structural walls or portions not indicated on the structural drawings are partition walls. Refer to architectural drawings for location and extent of partition walls.
6. Foundation sills shall be naturally durable or preservative-treated wood. Field-cut ends, notches and borings shall be field-treated. Fasteners in treated wood shall be approved silicon bronze/copper, stainless steel, or hot-dipped galvanized.
7. All wood framed structural walls are to be 2x4 studs @ 16" O.C. unless noted otherwise on the plan.
8. Anchor bolts shall be embedded at least 7" min. into concrete or masonry. Foundation spaced no more than 6' and provide a plate washer at each bolt.
9. Anchor bolts and holdown anchors shall be tied in place prior to foundation inspection. On raised floor holdown that use 5/8" or greater dia. strap wall with min. of 4 curing all length from mudge.
10. Shear wall sheathing shown on one side may alternatively be sheathed on the opposite side of the wall.
11. If adverse soil conditions are encountered, a soils investigation shall be required.
12. Extreme care should be taken when doing foundation work with post-tensioned slabs (where applicable). No tendons shall be damaged or cut. Notify the engineer of record prior to any drilling, coring, sawcutting, etc. Use non-destructive methods to locate tendons prior to any work.

## Shearwall Schedule (Bottom-Left)

| Mark | Type | Sheathing | Nail | Edge | Field | Sill Plate Conn. | Concrete | Allow. Shear | Shear |
|------|------|-----------|------|------|-------|-------------------|----------|-------------|-------|
| | | Size | Nail | | | | | Capacity | |
| STRUC 1 | 15d | 6" | 12" | 12" | 12" | 5/8"x10" A.B. | 4.35 @ 16" | 312 | (PLF) |

Notes below schedule:
- See detail S3.1 & S3.1 for all shearwall assemblies based on shear wall type
- D.S. indicates sheathing on one side of the wall & E.S. indicates sheathing on both sides
- Type 1 shearwalls have hold-down devices at each end
- Use min. 16 common nails min. for nails 1.5" installed over sheathing

## Pad Footing Schedule (Bottom-Center-Left)

| Type | Size (Width x Depth) | W. Bot. | Reinf. | Capacity (KIPS) | Size (Width x Depth) | W. Bot. | Reinf. | Capacity (KIPS) |
|------|---------------------|---------|--------|-----------------|---------------------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | 2'-0"x2'-0" | 2 | #4 | 3.84 | 3'-0"x1'-6" | 4 | #5 | 16.50 |
| 2 | 2'-0"x1'-2" | 4 | #4 | 5.44 | 3'-6"x2'-0" | 4 | #5 | — |
| 3 | 2'-0"x1'-2" | 4 | #4 | 5.44 | 4'-0"x2'-6" | 4 | #5 | 21.60 |

Notes below schedule:
1. All pad footings shall have a min. bearing depth of 18" for interior conditions & 24" for exterior conditions.
2. Allowable capacity values are based on an allowable bearing pressure of 1,500 PSF.
3. Approximate footing sizes at some locations on drawing for the larger size and greater of the two capacity values listed.

## Conc. Grade Beam Schedule (Bottom-Left)

| Mark | Width | Depth(s) | Cont. Bars at Top and Bottom | Stirrup Bar and Spacing |
|------|-------|----------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| GB1 | 12" | 24" | 3-#4 at Top & 3-#4 at Bottom | #3 @ 12" Min. |

Notes:
- Conc. Min f'c: 3,000 PSI
- Min. bearing depth into competent soil

## TYP. Continuous Footing Note (Bottom-Right of Drawing)

TYP. CONTINUOUS FOOTING:
- 12" Wide x 24" Min. Bearing Depth
- Into competent soil w/ continuous 3-#4 T&B

## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Sheet identification as S2.0 Foundation Plan by Ramirez Structural Inc
- Title block information (project number 25-357, date 9/19/25, revision 09-19-25)
- Plan notes are mostly legible (12 numbered items)
- Legend symbols and descriptions readable
- Foundation plan drawing layout clearly shows column locations, holdowns, shearwall marks, and existing conditions
- HSS 4x4x1/4 column callouts clearly legible
- Grade Beam GB1: 12" wide x 24" deep, 3-#4 T&B, #3 stirrups @ 12"
- Concrete minimum f'c: 3,000 PSI
- Continuous footing: 12" wide x 24" min. bearing depth, 3-#4 T&B
- 1.75x14 LVL stringers @ 12" O.C. legible
- Scale: 1/4" = 1'-0"
- APPROVED stamp present

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Shearwall schedule values are dense and some columns are hard to read precisely — exact nail sizes and spacings may have minor inaccuracies
- Pad footing schedule has multiple columns with small text; some capacity values and rebar counts may be approximate
- Some plan notes text (items 8-12) gets increasingly difficult to read at smaller font size
- Exact dimensions of some pad footing types could have minor reading errors
- Some detail reference callouts on the drawing (e.g., detail 10/S3.3, 10/S5.5) are small but important
