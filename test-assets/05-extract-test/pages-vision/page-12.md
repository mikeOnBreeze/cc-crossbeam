## Floor Framing Plan Drawing (Center-Right)

Plan view of the floor framing layout for the ADU above the existing garage:

### Framing Members Shown:
- **TYP. WALL STUD FRAMING** — 2x4 studs @ 16" O.C.
- **2x6 RAFTER @ 24" O.C.** — at upper portion of plan
- **Shaped hip/valley area** — 3 x 5.5 PSL HDR (shaped header at roof transition)
- **2x14 JOIST @ 16" O.C.** — primary floor joists running through center of plan
- **2x12 JOIST @ 16" O.C.** — floor joists in portions of the plan
- **TYP. FLOOR SHEATHING** — 3/4" APA-RATED STR.C, T&G, sheathing (4x8), at 16" O.C. nailing
- **TYP. ROOF SHEATHING** — 1/2" APA RATED EXP.1, sheathing (32/16), w/ clips (no blocking required if staggered)

### Strap Locations:
- **STRAP1** through **STRAP5** marked at various locations around perimeter
- Straps connecting floor framing to shearwall posts and holdowns below

### Key Callouts:
- **2x6 RAFTER (24" O.C.)** — at upper level framing
- **2x14 JOIST @ 16" O.C.** — main floor joists
- **2x12 JOIST @ 16" O.C.** — secondary floor joists
- **4x4 TYP** — posts at corners and connections
- **F.N. = 10d @ 12"** — field nailing specification for sheathing
- **R.N. = 6d** — Roof nailing specification

### Roof Framing Notes:
- **TYP. ROOF SHEATHING: 1/2" APA RATED EXP.1 SHEATHING (32/16), w/ clips** (no blocking required if staggered)

Scale: **1/4" = 1'-0"**

## Strap Schedule (Bottom-Left)

| Mark | Strap Model | Length | Nails Required within End Length "L" | Capacity (KIPS, A.C.I) | Provide Holdown Size @ Foundation |
|------|------------|--------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| STRAP1 | CS16 | 9" | 16-10d | 1,371 (D) | HDU2 |
| STRAP2 | CS16 | 11" | 20-10d | 1,701 (28) | HDU2 |
| STRAP3 | 2-CS16 | 9" | 32-10d | 2,742 (M) | HDU4 |
| STRAP4 | 2-CS16 | 11" | 40-10d | 3,412 (56) | HDU5 |
| STRAP5 | CMSTC16 | 20" | 50-10d SINKER | 4,683 (52) | HDU5 |

| STRAP7 | CMST12 | 33" | 74-16d | 9,228 (81) | HDU11 |

Notes:
1. Strap connection to framing below per detail S3/S.1
2. Strap goes over top plate, post to engineered and provide adequate per table.
3. Install strap over sheathing. Sheathing nailing required in addition to strap nailing.

## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Sheet identification as S2.1 Floor Framing Plan by Ramirez Structural Inc
- Title block information (project number 25-357, date 9/19/25)
- Floor framing layout clearly shows joist sizes and spacing (2x14 @ 16" O.C., 2x12 @ 16" O.C.)
- Rafter size: 2x6 @ 24" O.C.
- Floor sheathing: 3/4" APA-RATED STR.C, T&G at 16" O.C. nailing
- Roof sheathing: 1/2" APA RATED EXP.1 (32/16) w/ clips
- Strap schedule with 7 strap marks clearly readable (CS16, 2-CS16, CMSTC16, CMST14, CMST12 models)
- Holdown sizes at foundation: HDU2, HDU4, HDU5, HDU8, HDU11
- Wall stud framing: 2x4 @ 16" O.C. typical
- Scale: 1/4" = 1'-0"
- Legend symbols with detail references (12/S3.2, 3/S3.2, 6/S3.2, 2/S3.2)
- Field nailing F.N. = 10d @ 12"
- APPROVED stamp present

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some strap schedule capacity values may have minor reading errors due to small text
- Nail count column in strap schedule has dense text
- Some detail reference callouts on the framing plan are small
- 3 x 5.5 PSL HDR specification text is small and partially at edge of legibility
- Some plan notes (items 7-11) become increasingly difficult to read
- Exact strap model suffixes and nail specifications may have minor discrepancies
- Rafter framing zone boundary is somewhat unclear in the plan view
