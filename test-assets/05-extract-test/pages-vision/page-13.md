### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some splice type numbers at walls are small and partially obscured

- Some detail reference bubble numbers in the plan area are small (e.g., circled numbers referencing details on other sheets)
- The APPROVED stamp partially overlaps the upper portion of the framing plan
