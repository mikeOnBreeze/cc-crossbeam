  "description": "Structural typical details sheet with 8 detail drawings covering partition wall anchorage, slab-on-grade, stepping footing, reinforcement ties/stirrups, footing at pipe/conduit, footing intersections, plate splice fix, and sill bolt/hooks details.",
  "key_content": [
    "Detail 3: Partition top connection — Simpson STC @ 48\" O.C. (parallel to joist), Simpson HTC @ 48\" O.C. (perpendicular)",
    "Detail 3: Shot pins — Hilti S 1/4\" dia. x 2\" long power-driven pins @ 32\" O.C., 1/2\" min concrete penetration",
    "Detail 3: Anchor bolt at curb — 1/2\" dia. headed anchor x 8\" @ 48\" O.C. max",
    "Detail 1: Slab on grade — weakened plane joint (sawcut), vapor barrier, clean gravel, 12\" min step height",
    "Detail 7: Stepping continuous footing — reinforcement same size and spacing as footing reinforcement, top bars where occurs",
    "Detail 5: Reinforcement — tie splice alternation, column ties (ductile and optional), beam stirrups, bend 4 db minimum",
    "Detail 12: Footing at pipe/conduit — 90% compaction, sleeve I.D. 2\" min larger than pipe O.D., no pipes within restricted height zone",
    "Detail 11: Footing intersections — 2 #5 cont., 2 #5 vertical U.O.N., outside corner lap bars, std 90-degree hook at inside bars",
    "Detail 10: Plate splice fix — 6-16d each side of splice, required when gap > 8\"",
    "Detail 9: Sill bolt detail — 2x filler pieces to bridge bolt head, studs @ 16\" O.C.",
    "NOT SHOWN: shearwall schedule (likely on separate detail sheet)",
    "NOT SHOWN: holdown schedule (likely on separate detail sheet)"
