## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Sheet identification as S3.0 Typical Details by Ramirez Structural Inc
- Detail numbers and titles clearly legible (Details 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12)
- Partition wall anchorage: Simpson STC @ 48" O.C. (parallel), Simpson HTC @ 48" O.C. (perpendicular)

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- APPROVED stamp overlaps Detail 10 area, partially obscuring some text
- Some specific dimension values in slab-on-grade detail are small
- Bar diameter values in Detail 5 (Reinforcement) tie specifications are difficult to read precisely
- Hook and bend dimensions in Detail 9 are very small text
- Some footing detail dimensions in Details 11 and 12 are at the limit of legibility
