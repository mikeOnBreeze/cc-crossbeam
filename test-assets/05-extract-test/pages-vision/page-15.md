## Confidence Notes
### High Confidence Extractions
- Sheet identification as S3.1 Typical Details by Ramirez Structural Inc
- Detail numbers and layout positions clearly identifiable (Details 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8)
- Shearwall assembly types: sheathing on both sides (Detail 7) vs. sheathing on one side (Detail 5)
- Holdown and sill anchor detail showing slab and raised footing configurations (Detail 8)
- Shearwall intersection framing patterns (Detail 1)
- Tie plate and anchor bolt configurations (Detail 3)
- APPROVED stamp present

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Specific nail sizes and spacing values within shearwall assembly notes are very small at this resolution and not fully legible
- Sheathing thickness and grade specifications within detail notes are difficult to read precisely
- Anchor bolt diameter and embedment depth values in Detail 8 sub-details are at the limit of legibility
- Bolt edge distance values in Detail 3 are small text
- Construction notes below Details 7 and 5 contain dense small text that cannot be read word-for-word at this resolution
- APPROVED stamp partially overlaps Detail 1 shearwall intersection drawing
- Project number and date in title block are partially legible due to image resolution
