## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information clearly legible
- Header schedule table values
- Top plate splice table values
- Boring and notching diagram proportions and rules
- Detail numbering and general notes

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- APPROVED stamp partially obscures Detail 6 (ceiling joist detail) text — some notes in that zone may be incomplete
- Some very small text in nailing specifications may have minor transcription errors
- Design load values in top plate splice table — last row partially cut off
- Some nail spacing callouts in tight detail areas may be approximate
