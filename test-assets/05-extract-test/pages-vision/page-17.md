## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block clearly legible
- Strap holdown sub-details (A, B, C, D) well labeled and notes readable
- Partition bottom connection, ledger splice, and engineered beam to post details clear
- Detail 10 and 11 nailer-on-beam connection details legible

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- APPROVED stamp overlaps Detail 10 area slightly — some small text in that zone may be partially obscured
- Detail 2 area between ledger splice and engineered beam to post is not clearly labeled as a separate detail
- Some nailing specs in very small text within strap holdown details may have minor transcription imprecision
- Bolt sizes and stagger dimensions in Details 10 and 11 are small text
