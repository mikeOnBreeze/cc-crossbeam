## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information clearly legible
- Base plate plans A, B, C with dimensions and specifications
- Fillet weld schedule table values
- Hilti Kwik Bolts optional anchor specification with ESR number
- Steel beam end connection dimensions and stiffener plate specs
- Column base plate detail 4 dimensions

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Detail numbering in lower portion — zones 9-12 appear to be empty/unused on this sheet
- Some weld callout dimensions on Detail 2 are very small (5/16" markings)
- Detail 1 content is minimal and may be a continuation rather than standalone detail
- The hc/hp dimension labels on Plan A/B/C base plates are small and partially unclear
- License stamp/seal number: C 91046 with expiration 03-31-26 (read from small seal)
