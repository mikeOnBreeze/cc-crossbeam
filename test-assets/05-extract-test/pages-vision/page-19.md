## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information (firm, project, sheet number, date)
- Detail numbering and general layout (12 details total)
- Epoxy anchor specifications (SET-3G, ICC-ES references)
- Special inspection required callouts
- Holdown and shearwall connection references

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some reinforcement bar sizes in Details 1 and 5 are small and partially obscured
- Detail 7 is partially covered by the APPROVED stamp, obscuring some annotation text
- Exact rebar callout sizes in Detail 2 (the "#3 x --" dimensions) are at the limit of legibility
- Some dimension values in Detail 5 (5" min., 9" min.) may have additional annotations not fully legible
