## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information (firm, project, sheet number, date)
- Detail numbering and layout (12 details total)
- Shearwall schedule references and SDS fastener specs
- ECCO column cap and connection detail references
- Guardrail specifications (HSS sizes, 4" sphere rule)
- Strong wall connection detail with lag screw specs

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Detail 3 is partially covered by the APPROVED stamp
- Some E.N. (edge nailing) callout specifics may have additional small annotations not fully legible
- The Hilti bolt specification in Detail 10 (diameter and ICC reference) is at the limit of legibility
- LVL stringer dimension in Detail 8 (1-3/4" x 14") — the depth dimension is partially obscured
