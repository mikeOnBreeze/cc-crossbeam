## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information (firm, project, sheet number, date)
- Detail numbering across top and middle rows
- MSTA24 strap specification @ 48" O.C. (Detail 7)
- H2.5 hurricane tie at each rafter (Detail 2)
- 2x4 bracing @ 48" O.C. w/ 3-16d nails E.A. end (multiple details)
- Shear clip per shearwall schedule references (multiple details)
- Continuous double top plate splice callouts
- 5-16d clip nails typical (Detail 1)
- ECCO/CC column cap references

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- The lower portion of the sheet has overlapping detail numbering that is slightly confusing (upper row Details 4-1 vs. lower details that reuse similar numbering)
- Some text in the Note area at bottom-left ("Typical Beam to Steel Column") has small annotations that are partially legible
- "156 @ P.I. O.C." notation appears in multiple details — the "156" may be a nail specification (e.g., 15-6d or 15/6) but exact reading is uncertain
- Bottom row (Details 12-9) appears intentionally blank with only the approval stamp
