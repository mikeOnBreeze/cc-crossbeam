### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: Specific U-factor and SHGC values for individual windows (small text, CHEERS watermark overlay)
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: Exact R-values for wall, ceiling, and floor assemblies (small text in table cells)
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: HVAC system efficiency ratings (SEER2, HSPF2, AFUE)
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: Water heater type and efficiency (EF/UEF)
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: Compliance margin percentages (heating, cooling, water heating)
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: EDR (Energy Design Rating) value
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: Duct insulation R-value and sealing method specifics
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: PV solar system specifications (if present)
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: Most individual cell values in the tiled CF-1R tables due to very small text and watermark interference
- Page 2 of 7 of the CF-1R appears to be missing from the composited layout (pages shown: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
