## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Title block information: sheet T-3, LRO Designs, 326 Flint Ave Unit A, Long Beach CA 90814, date 4/22/2025, owner Brendan King
- Page header: "TITLE 24 NOTES" clearly legible at top
- Layout: Title 24 notes text on left side, five instances of "2022 Single Family Residential Mandatory Requirement Summary" forms arranged across the page
- APPROVED stamp details (Anthony Montez, 10/20/25)
- Standards edition: 2022 California Energy Code

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Specific text content within the Title 24 Notes narrative — very small font at this composited scale, individual paragraphs are at the limit of legibility
- Individual checkbox states (checked vs unchecked) in the mandatory requirement summary forms — cannot reliably determine compliance status of each line item
- Specific mandatory requirement descriptions — text is too small in the rasterized image to read individual line items with confidence
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: individual note paragraph details (small rasterized text)
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: specific checkbox compliance status for each mandatory requirement item
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: specific R-values, U-factors, or efficiency values mentioned in the notes text
