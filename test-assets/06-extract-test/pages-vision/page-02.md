- Information Bulletin BU-039
- Rev. 04-06-2017

**Introductory Text:**
Long Beach has two distinct drainage systems — the sewers and the storm drains. The storm drain system was designed to prevent flooding by carrying excess rainwater away from city streets out to the ocean. Best management practices such as handling, storing and disposing of materials properly prevents construction site pollutants from entering storm drains.

### GENERAL BUSINESS PRACTICES

#### BM01 SCHEDULING
Purpose: To reduce the discharge of pollutants from construction sites by sequencing the construction activities.
- Eliminate major grading operations during dry months
- Perform rain-sensitive work during the dry season as far as possible at any one time
- Close and stabilize open trenches as soon as possible

#### BM02 PRESERVATION OF EXISTING VEGETATION
Purpose: To reduce the discharge of pollutants from construction sites by using dust control measures to stabilize soil and prevent erosion and sedimentation.
- Delineate clearing limits, sensitive/critical areas and trees
- Direct traffic to stabilized areas within the project
- Preserve stabilized areas of the site as long as feasible and avoid grading during rainy season

#### BM03A STABILIZED CONSTRUCTION ENTRANCE
Purpose: To reduce tracking of pollutants from construction sites by reducing the amount of construction site sediment that is tracked onto public roads.
- Stabilize construction entrance with aggregates underlain with filter cloth
- Construction entrance shall be located at the main access point
- Width should be 20 feet minimum, or the full width of the access point
- Length should be 50 foot minimum, and width 30 foot minimum

## BU-039 Continued: Erosion Control BMPs (Top-Right Quadrant)

#### BM03C SILT FENCE
Purpose: To reduce the discharge of pollutants from construction sites utilizing a silt fence that detains sediment laden water, promoting sedimentation behind the fence.
- Use filter fabric that retains 85% of soil
- Silt fence, which is made of filter fabric, should be entrenched and attached to supporting poles
- End treatment is necessary

#### BM03E SAND BAG BARRIER
Purpose: To reduce the discharge of pollutants from construction site by staining sand bags around the perimeter.
- Sandbags should be placed properly to maintain adequate filtering
- Use sand bags large enough to withstand flooding
- Reinforce or replace sand bags as needed to create a temporary sediment barrier
- Inspect events and after each rain
- Make repairs and remove sediment if necessary when basin is half full
- Line basin if ground water is within 1 ft of bottom

## BU-038: Construction Activity Best Management Practices (Bottom-Left Quadrant)

**Header:**
- City of Long Beach, Department of Development Services
- Building and Safety Bureau
- Information Bulletin BU-038

**Introductory Text:**
Long Beach has two drainage systems — the sewers and the storm drains. The storm drain system was designed to prevent flooding. This information bulletin will describe how to prevent stormwater pollution from construction site activities.

### CA02 WATER CONSERVATION PRACTICE
Purpose: To reduce the discharge of pollutants from construction sites by using construction water that does not contaminate the storm drain system.
- Discourage washing of equipment on site
- Conduct washing activities in a designated area. Sweep paved areas where practical.
- Direct construction water run-off to areas where it can soak into the ground
- Do not let muddy or contaminated water enter storm drains

### CA10 MATERIAL DELIVERY AND STORAGE
Purpose: To minimize the discharge of pollutants from construction sites during the delivery and storage process by minimizing or eliminating exposure.
- Designate storage areas at the project site
- Protect storage areas from contaminating soil or soaking into the ground
- Do not store materials in the street or near storm drains. Keep a list of material storage areas.
- Inspect materials directly on the ground
- Monitor hazardous material storage on site
- Stack all loose items, materials on pallets and keep them well labeled
- Cover stockpile with plastic or tarp material near storage areas
- Contain and clean up any spill immediately

## BU-038 Continued: Construction Activity BMPs (Bottom-Right Quadrant)

### CA11 MATERIAL USE
Purpose: To reduce the discharge of pollutants by properly storing and utilizing materials.
- Use materials only where and when needed to complete the construction activity
- Follow manufacturer's recommendations for proper storage
- Avoid exposing applied materials to rainfall and run-off unless sufficient time has allowed for them to dry or set

### CA52 SPILL PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Purpose: To reduce the risk of pollutants from construction site spills by preventing, containing and clean-up spills as quickly as possible.
- Store materials covered in a designated area
- Use absorbent materials on small spills rather than hosing down or flushing the spill
- Keep a stockpile of spill cleanup materials nearby and train subcontractors on their use

### CA53 SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
Purpose: To manage waste materials produced as a result of the creation, demolishing and removal of building materials.
- Keep site clean kept regularly, daily during rainy and windy conditions
- Provide sufficient number of waste containers
- Cover all waste containers and regularly sweep exposed areas. Place waste containers/dumpsters designed for container that limits contact with rain, run off, and/or washing due to winds.

### CA54 HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT
Purpose: To prevent or reduce the pollution of stormwater by the proper storage and disposal of waste.
- Sites with existing structures may contain waste which must be disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations. Hazardous waste includes oil, solvents, lead, asbestos, and other toxic materials.
- Major contamination, large spills, and other serious hazardous waste incidents require immediate notification to authorities
- Clearly mark on all hazardous waste containers which materials are acceptable for the container

### CA57 CONCRETE WASTE MANAGEMENT
Purpose: Collect and properly dispose of concrete waste, concrete grindings and applied to all concrete on-site construction, slurry, stucco/mortar, housing/preformed and compaction.
- Do not wash tools in stormwater; do not allow wash water into storm drains
- Perform off-site recycling facility cleanup and dispose in a temporary pit
- Establish a temporary concrete washout for use; facility should be large enough to hold all concrete waste generated

### CA55 VEHICLE AND EQUIPMENT CLEANING
- Clean all vehicles and equipment that regularly enter and leave the construction site to remove pollutant buildup. Flush accumulated debris in the designated areas close to handler, the stormwater and water sewer.

### CA56 VEHICLE AND EQUIPMENT FUELING
- Clean all vehicles and equipment that regularly enter and leave the construction site
- Inspect frequently and perform maintenance on all vehicles and equipment, and related activities/tasks often

### CA59 VEHICLE AND EQUIPMENT FUELING
- Protect fueling areas with berms and/or dikes to prevent runoff, run-off, and to contain spills
- Use drip pans/absorbent pads during fueling of on-site vehicles and equipment fueling by preventing discharge of pollutants
- Protect fueling areas with berms and/or dikes to prevent runoff, run-off, and to contain spills
- Keep fuel tanks and lubricants for the project site

## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- BMP section headers and numbering (BM01, BM02, BM03A, BM03C, BM03E, CA02, CA10, CA11, CA52, CA53, CA54, CA55, CA56, CA57, CA59)
- City of Long Beach bulletin numbers (BU-039, BU-038)
- General content and purpose of each BMP section
- Title block: Sheet CCS.1, Ideal Design Group, project address 326 Flint Ave
- APPROVED stamp present

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Exact bullet point text within each BMP section — very small font, some words may be approximate
- Title block details at right edge are compressed in vertical orientation, some text partially cut off
- Permit/project number "IB-056" vs Tesseract reading "18-056" — the Tesseract reading may indicate "18-056" rather than "IB-056"
- "25-RAAUNT" plan check number is partially legible
- "Residential Bathroom Remodel" appears in the title block area but conflicts with the ADU project description — likely a template/reuse artifact
- Page footer text ("This information is available in an alternative format by request to (562) 570-3807") is very small
