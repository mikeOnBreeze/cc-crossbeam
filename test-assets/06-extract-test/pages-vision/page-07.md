|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dormer vents 24"x14" | — | 400.00 | S.I. | — |
| Gable vents (size referenced) | — | — | S.I. | — |
| Cable vents/soffit vents | — | 140.00 | S.I. | — |
| **TOTAL (N) NET FREE VENTILATION** | | **540.00** | S.I. | — |

### Ventilation Notes
1. All openings shall be placed so as to provide cross ventilation to the entire attic
2. Ventilation openings shall open directly to the outside air
3. Openings shall be covered with corrosion-resistant wire mesh with min. 1/16" and max 1/4" mesh openings
4. Area vents must be within 3 ft of the ridge
5. The balance provided by low eave or cornice vents must be within 3 ft from the eave
