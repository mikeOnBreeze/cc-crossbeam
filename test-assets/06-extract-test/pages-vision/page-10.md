## Form G01 — Structural Observation Designation (Left Column)

City of Long Beach Community Development Department form.

### Structural Observation Designation
- **Form:** FORM G01
- **Title:** Structural Observation Designation
- **Reference:** STRUCTURAL OBSERVATION DESIGN per required by CBC Section 1704.6
- **Description:** The registered design professional responsible for the structural design shall identify the frequency and extent of required structural observations. The structural observation program is provided to the Building Official and Registered Design Professional to determine that the lateral force-resisting system is constructed in general conformance with the approved construction documents. Structural observation does not waive the requirements for special inspection or eliminate the requirement for the Contractor to provide special inspection or structural observation as required by the building permit or commencement of structural observations.
- **Code References:** CBC = 2022 Edition of the California Building Code, LBMC = Long Beach Municipal Code
- **Note:** For additional information regarding the structural observation requirement of CBC Section 1704.6 as amended by LBMC Section 18.04, refer to information bulletins available at the City of Long Beach Building Division website.

### Declaration and Acknowledgment Statement

**DECLARATION BY OWNER** (or authorized representative):
1. I, the Owner of this project, declare that the above listed individual is hired by me to be the Structural Observer of Record for this project in accordance with the provisions of the structural observation program.
2. I notify the Building Official or Long Beach building inspector before concealing any structural framing in the lateral force-resisting system to arrange for proper structural observation.

**DECLARATION BY REGISTERED DESIGN PROFESSIONAL:** Required if the Structural Observer of Record is different from the Structural Designer of Record. The registered design professional responsible for the structural design declares that he or she has been notified that a different engineer has been appointed as the Structural Observer.
