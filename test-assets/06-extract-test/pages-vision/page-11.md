## Foundation Plan Drawing (Center — Main Area)

**Scale:** 1/4" = 1'-0"
**North Arrow:** Present (north pointing up-left)

### Drawing Description
Plan-view foundation layout showing the new ADU structure built above the existing garage. The drawing shows:

- **Existing structure:** Existing concrete slab (labeled "EXISTING CONC. SLAB") within the garage footprint. Existing 1'-0" wide continuous footing to be field verified (typical, at north side).
- **Existing 2x4 wall stud** to be field verified (east/right side).
- **New grade beam GB1** per schedule runs across the top (north) side of the structure, with 2'-3" cantilever at each end.
- **HSS 4x4x1/4 steel columns** (detail reference S4.0) at multiple locations around the perimeter and at midpoints — marked with circled numbers 3, 5, and detail reference S4.0.
- **4x4 wood posts** at multiple locations.
- **4x4 HDU2 holdown** locations at corners and along walls (holdown hardware at shearwall ends).
- **Two WSWH 24x9** elements (Simpson Wood Strong-Wall, 24" wide by 9' tall) shown in the lower-center area of the plan, spaced at 6'-0" apart.
- **Typical continuous footing:** 1'-0" wide x 24" min. bearing depth into competent soil w/ continuous 2-#4 T&B (callout box at bottom of drawing).
- **Stair area** shown at bottom-left with 1.75x14 LVL stringers @ 12" O.C. and hatched stair pattern.
- **#5 @ 12" O.C. each way, T&B** rebar in the footing area between the two strong walls.
- **Detail references** throughout: circled numbers referencing details on sheets S3.0, S3.1, S3.3, and S4.0.

### Key Callout Notes on Drawing
- "USE 3x SIDE NAILER PER DETAIL 10/S3.3 AND EDGE NAIL SHEAR WALL TO COLUMN IN LIEU OF HOLDOWN" (upper-right area)
- "TYP. WALL STUD FRAMING: 2x4 STUDS @16" O.C." (mid-right area)
- "USE 3x SIDE NAILER PER DETAIL 10/S3.3 AND USE LPT5 AT 16" O.C. STAGGERED ON EA. FACE OF STRONG WALL TO NAILER PER DETAIL 10/S5.0, TYP." (lower-right area)
- "EXISTING 1'-0" WIDE CONT. FOOTING TO BE FIELD VERIFIED TYPICAL" (left side)
- "EXISTING 2x4 WALL STUD TO BE FIELD VERIFIED" (right side)
- "HSS 4x4x1/4 COLUMN FULL HT. FOUNDATION TO ROOF" (multiple locations, detail S4.0, TYP.)
- "GB1 PER SCHEDULE" (along top grade beam)

### Column Layout (Detail S4.0 References)
Multiple HSS 4x4x1/4 columns from foundation to roof, with pad footing references. Column locations at:
- Four corners of the structure
- Midpoints along the top (north) grade beam
- Along the east and west walls
- At the strong wall locations

## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions

- Grade beam GB1: 12" wide x 24" deep, 3-#4 T&B, #3 stirrups @ 12" min.
- Concrete min f'c = 3,000 PSI
- Typical continuous footing: 1'-0" wide x 24" min. bearing depth, 2-#4 T&B
- Pad footing schedule: 6 types from 1.5 (1'-6" sq.) to 4.0 (4'-0" sq.), all 12" thick
- Allowable bearing pressure: 1,500 PSF
- Shearwall Mark 1: STRUC 1, O.S., 10d nails, 6" edge / 12" field, 312 PLF
- HSS 4x4x1/4 columns full height foundation to roof
- WSWH 24x9 (Simpson Wood Strong-Wall) at two locations, 6'-0" spacing
- 1.75x14 LVL stringers @ 12" O.C. (stair area)
- Anchor bolts: 7" min. embedment, 48" max. spacing, 0.299"x3"x3" plate washer
- Wall stud framing: 2x4 @ 16" O.C. typical; 2x6 @ 16" O.C. at plumbing walls
- #5 @ 12" O.C. each way T&B (at strong wall footings)
- Holdown hardware: HDU2 (Simpson) at multiple corners/shearwall ends
- 3x side nailer per detail 10/S3.3 in lieu of holdown at column locations
- LPT5 at 16" O.C. staggered on each face of strong wall to nailer

### Lower Confidence / Partially Obscured
- Some detail reference numbers in drawing are small but appear consistent (S3.0, S3.1, S3.3, S4.0, S5.0)
- Shearwall schedule SDS bolt specification partially legible (appears SDS"x6" @ 16")
- Some text near the holdown/post callouts overlaps in the drawing
- Exact cantilever dimension at GB1 ends reads as 2'-3" but could be verified against detail sheets
