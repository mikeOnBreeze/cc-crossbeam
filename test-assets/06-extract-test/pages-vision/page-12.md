## Plan Notes (top-left)

1. Refer to structural notes on sheet S1.0 and typical details on sheets S3.0-S3.1. These notes and details shall be used where applicable whether specifically referenced on plans or not.
2. Contractor shall coordinate the work of all trades. If structural requirements indicated, refer to architectural, civil, mechanical, plumbing and electrical drawings.
3. Refer to architectural drawings for all dimensions.
4. Structural walls are walls that resist gravity, wind, and/or seismic loads. All exterior wood framed walls are structural walls. Walls or portions not indicated on the structural drawings are partition walls. Refer to architectural drawings for location and extent of.
5. Normal floor line varies. Refer to architectural.
6. Walls below floor sheathing are indicated by dashed lines. Walls above floor sheathing are indicated by solid lines.
7. Beams in contact with floor sheathing or directly below roof framing are indicated with solid lines. Any other beam at a lower level is indicated with dashed lines.
8. Size and location of all mechanical equipment to be reviewed and approved by the E.O.R. prior to placement.
9. For size and location of roof openings for pipes and ducts, refer to mechanical and plumbing drawings.
10. All wood exposed to weather to be treated wood, redwood, or other species naturally resistant to decay and joist hangers, straps, ties, etc. shall be galvanized (G185 coating). Fasteners shall be stainless steel or approved equal.
11. Shear wall sheathing shown on one side may alternatively be sheathed on the opposite side of the wall.

## Floor Framing Plan Drawing (center)

The plan-view drawing shows the second-story ADU floor framing over the existing garage. Key framing elements visible:

### Wall Stud Framing
- **Typ. Wall Stud Framing:** 2x4 studs @ 16" O.C.

### Floor Sheathing
- **Typ. Floor Sheathing:** 3/4" APA Rated Struc-1, T&G, Sheathing (APA) 24/0
  - E.N. = 10d @ 6"
  - F.N. = 10d @ 12"
  - (No blocking required at seams)

### Roof Sheathing
- **Typ. Roof Sheathing:** 12" APA Rated Exp-1, 32/16
  - E.N. = 8d @ 6"
  - F.N. = 8d @ 12"
  - (No blocking required at seams)

### Framing Members
- **2x12 Joist @ 16" O.C.** — primary floor framing in several bays
- **2x14 Joist @ 16" O.C.** — deeper joists in specific areas
- **2x6 Rafter @ 24" O.C.** — roof rafters at building edges
- **2x6 Rafter @ 16" O.C.** — roof framing at gable areas

- **4x4 posts** — multiple locations, with STRAP callouts at base
- **4x_ headers** — at openings (installed per detail 5/S3.2)

### Shearwall & Strap Callouts
- Multiple **STRAP1** callouts at shearwall post locations around perimeter
- **STRAP3** callouts at multiple interior/exterior post locations
- **STRAP5** callouts at several locations
- **S3.3** reference callout (shearwall detail reference)
- **B.S.** (blocking/stiffener) callouts at several points

### Key Dimensions Visible

## Strap Schedule (bottom-left)

| Mark | Strap Model | End Length "L" | Nails Required Within End Length "L" | Capacity (KIPS) (ALC/CITY) | Provide Holdown Size (@ Foundation) |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| STRAP1 | CS18 | 9" | 16-10d | 1.31(1.03) | HDU1 |
| STRAP2 | CS16 | 11" | 20-10d | 1.70(1.28) | HDU2 |
| STRAP3 | 2-CS18 | 9" | 32-10d | 2.74(2.06) | HDU4 |

## Confidence Notes

- **High confidence:** Strap schedule values, framing callouts, floor/roof sheathing specs, plan notes, title block info
- **Medium confidence:** Some dimension values in the framing plan are partially obscured; the "30x14 MSR" beam callout may read differently at higher resolution
- **Low confidence:** Exact nail count figures in strap schedule rows 5-7 should be verified against Tesseract OCR or higher-res source

## Absent Items

- NOT SHOWN: Joist hanger schedule (specific model numbers for each connection)
- NOT SHOWN: Blocking layout at shearwall locations (referenced but not dimensioned on this sheet)
- NOT SHOWN: Simpson hardware model numbers for joist-to-beam connections (referenced to detail sheets S3.0-S3.2)
