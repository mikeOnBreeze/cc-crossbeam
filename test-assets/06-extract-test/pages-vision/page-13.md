2. Contractor shall coordinate the work of all trades with structural requirements indicated. Refer to architectural, civil, mechanical, plumbing and electrical drawings.
3. Refer to architectural drawings for all dimensions.
4. Structural walls are walls that resist gravity, wind, and/or seismic loads. All exterior wood framed walls are structural walls. Walls or portions not indicated on the structural drawings are partition walls. Refer to architectural drawings for location and extent of.
5. Nominal roof line varies. Refer to architectural.
6. Walls below roof sheathing are indicated by dashed lines. Walls above roof sheathing are indicated by solid lines.
7. Beams in contact with roof sheathing or directly below roof framing are indicated with solid lines. Any other beam at a lower level is indicated with dashed lines.
8. Size and location of all mechanical equipment to be reviewed and approved by the E.O.R. prior to placement.

## Roof Framing Plan Drawing (center)

The plan-view drawing shows the roof framing layout for the second-story ADU above the existing garage. The roof consists of a hip/gable configuration with rafters converging toward a central ridge board.

### Roof Sheathing
- **Typ. Roof Sheathing:** 1/2" APA Rated EXP-1, Sheathing (32/16), w/
  - E.N. = 8d @ 6"
  - F.N. = 8d @ 12"
  - (No blocking required at seams)

### Framing Members
- **2x6 Rafters @ 16" O.C.** — primary roof framing in multiple bays radiating from the ridge board
- **2x6 Ridge Board** — central ridge running approximately east-west through the plan
- **2x10 C.J. @ 16" O.C.** — ceiling joists in the central area
- **3-1/2x9-1/4 PSL** — engineered Parallel Strand Lumber beam near bottom of plan
- **4x4 posts** — at multiple locations including corners and intermediate supports
- **4x6** — members at corners/intersections

### Detail Reference Callouts (circled numbers)
- **1/S6.0** — detail reference at top area
- **2/S6.0** — detail reference
- **3/S6.0** — detail reference (near typical roof sheathing note)
- **4/S6.0** — detail reference at left side
- **5/S6.0** — detail reference
- **6/S3.2** — detail reference at lower area
- **7/S5.0** — detail reference at bottom-right area (cripple wall above beam)
- **8/S3.2** — detail reference at lower area
- **1/S3.2** — detail reference at upper area

### Shearwall / Cripple Wall Notes
- **Sheath cripple wall above beam with Type 6 sheathing** — see detail 7/S5.0 (noted at bottom-right of plan area)

### Top Plate Splice
- Type [6] splice minimum at marked locations unless otherwise noted (per schedule on 2/S3.2)

## Confidence Notes

- **High confidence:** Sheet ID (S2.2), title block info, sheathing specs (1/2" APA Rated EXP-1 32/16), nailing (E.N. = 8d @ 6", F.N. = 8d @ 12"), rafter size (2x6 @ 16" O.C.), ridge board (2x6), ceiling joist (2x10 C.J. @ 16" O.C.), PSL beam (3-1/2x9-1/4 PSL), plan notes, legend, APPROVED stamp
- **Medium confidence:** Detail callout sheet references (S6.0, S5.0, S3.2) — small text in circles, mostly legible but some callouts partially obscured by framing lines
- **Low confidence:** Exact dimensions/spacing of some framing members in congested areas of the plan; the "BAD032612B" stamp ID — characters are small
