## Content Overview

Structural typical detail sheet (S3.1) continuing from S3.0, with details covering plate bolting and anchor bolts, shearwall intersections, shearwall assemblies (both sides and one side sheathing), holdown and SSTB anchor schedule, and general structural notes. Page includes an APPROVED stamp (red box, center area). Contains 5 major detail zones plus notes and a holdown/SSTB schedule table.

## Detail — SHEARWALL ASSEMBLY w/ SHEATHING ON BOTH SIDES (middle-left)

### Shear Clip Detail (left side)
- Second sheathing nailed to 2x members
- 1 type edge nailing
- Framing as required
- Plates staggered
- Edge nailing to HD blocking per plan
- LTF4 & A35 spacing (see note 6)

### Assembly Description (Detail 7, center)
- Top plate splice per plan
- Typo edge nailing per plan
- Floor framing/header
- Edge nailing to HD
- Blocking @ all panels
- Post per plan
- Slab on grade or floor

### Shearwall Type Table

| Holdown Per Plan | Type | Type |
|------------------|------|------|
| (values) | 2-2x | 2-3xf |
| Edge stud | 3x | 4xf |
| (values) | - | - |

### Notes:
1. Sheathing on one side of the shear wall must be nailed completely before the remaining sheathing is started and inspected prior to installation of wall
2. All plates of shearwall more than 4" or more carry of the second sheathing shall be bolted or nailed — show the lines of the second sheathing with more clarity on the drawing

- Typ. edge nailing per plan
- Sheathing @ openings for stud spacing (see notes)
- Edge nailing to HD (see note 6)
- Blocking @ all panels
- Post per plan
- Slab on grade or floor

### Shearwall Type / Staggered Nailing Table

| Type | Edge Stud | Floor |

### Notes Below Schedule:
1. Concrete end distances for SSTB & SB bolts are as shown in graphics
2. All connections at shearwalls shall be designed for both uplift forces acting in tension shall transfer. The minimum bolt center-to-center spacing is 1.1
3. All corners at shearwall connections at the bottom sill plate must be within 0 min. 1x section of wall
4. A minimum 3x4 washer is required on each bolt, except where noted
5. Footing, slab, floor framing & sheathing are not shown for clarity on elevations corner
6. A minimum 3x bolts required at each bolt location
7. Rebar is required at the top of stem wall foundations, but is not required for slab-on-grade and are adequate per the Tesseract cannot verify all values here (small text)
8. On garage: use a rod & coupler as shown alternative on slab detail
