- Use double joists on T.P. (or) @ each side of openings at top, 1-1/2" or more
- Note: Use this detail for openings not specifically detailed or where joist/beam is interrupted
- See plans for joist size and spacing
- Blocking: solid between webs at 4' O.C.

## Detail 3 — Roof/Floor Diaphragm Assembly (Top-Center-Left)

- See plan for sheathing thickness, span, grade, and nailing
- P/S sheathing
- Edge nailing (EN) at diaphragm edges
- Edge nailing (EN) at intermediate panel edges
- Stagger 1/8" minimum panel joints
- Blocking at panel edges is required where noted per plan
- See plan for diaphragm assembly

- X = joist/rafter; B = studs in walls
- Reference to joists per plan

## Detail 1 — Boring and Notching (Top-Right)

- Notching not allowed within 1/3 span in middle
- Bored holes limitations shown in cross-section diagram
- Shows acceptable zones for boring vs. notching relative to member depth

## Detail 5 — Header Detail (Center-Right)

### Bearing and Header Schedule

| Opening Width | Header Size | Opening Width | Bearing Walls | In Stud Walls |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| (varies by opening) | (varies) | (varies) | (varies) | (varies) |

- A4x4 at top & bottom king studs
- Height studs in exterior walls
- Cont. dbl. top plates, per plan
- 10d @ 8" O.C., each full height stud @ exterior walls only
- When studs not cont.: 10d @ 8" O.C., each full height opening stud
- Per plan of non on plan:
  - 2-16d for each 2" in header depth
  - 3-16d for each 3" in header depth
  - Use 16d @ 8" O.C. each stud when longer than two other strings
  - Anchor occurs — see plan and typical holdown detail

### Opening Stud Table Reference

- Number of full height studs at exterior walls only
- See table for number of opening studs at exterior walls
- Stud & cripples @ 16" O.C.
- A3M for 2 to 6' openings reference

## Key Observations

- This is the third typical details sheet (S3.2) from Ramirez Structural Inc
- All details are framing connection and assembly standards
- Header schedule provides opening-width-to-header-size relationships
- Boring and notching detail establishes limits for field modifications
- Diaphragm assembly detail references nailing schedule from plans
- Top plate splice requires 4'-0" minimum lap length
- Multiple Simpson hardware references (U hanger, GLT hanger, TW!, joist clip)
- 10d nails @ 8" O.C. is recurring spacing for full height stud connections

---

## Confidence Notes

- **High confidence:** Detail titles, general layout, Simpson hardware references, nailing patterns (10d @ 8" O.C.)
- **Medium confidence:** Some table values in Header Schedule (Detail 5) and Top Plate Splice table (Detail 2) are small and partially legible
- **Low confidence:** Some specific dimension callouts in the finer text of Detail 7 beam configurations; OCR text is heavily garbled for this page, limiting cross-reference utility
