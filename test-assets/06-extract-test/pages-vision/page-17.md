## Key Observations

- This is the fourth typical details sheet (S3.3) from Ramirez Structural Inc
- Focus areas: strap holdowns (4 sub-detail configurations), beam-to-post connections, steel base plate anchoring, partition bottom connections
- Strap holdown details (D, C, B, A) cover all common conditions: to header, to drope (dropped) beam, to flush beam, and standard
- All strap holdowns specify minimum 4x4 holdown post
- Steel base plate details (10, 11) show bolt patterns with 1/2" and 3/4" DIA bolts
- 1/2 bolts @ 36" (stagger) is the recurring anchor bolt spacing for base plates
- Simpson BC post cap referenced for post-over-beam condition
- CC post cap and ECC post cap referenced for engineered beam-to-post connections
- APPROVED stamp from Anthony Montes — Building Plan Check

## Confidence Notes

- **High confidence:** Detail titles, layout arrangement, strap holdown configurations (D/C/B/A), Simpson hardware references (BC post cap, CC post cap, ECC post cap), bolt specifications (1/2" and 3/4" DIA), base plate details
- **Medium confidence:** Some specific dimensions in Detail 10 (maximum base plate bolt pattern) — small text, cross-referenced with OCR where possible. Ledger splice (Detail 3) sub-detail strap types partially legible.
- **Low confidence:** OCR text is heavily garbled for this page — primarily useful for confirming detail titles and some numeric values. Fine print notes within strap holdown sub-details are partially obscured by drawing density.
