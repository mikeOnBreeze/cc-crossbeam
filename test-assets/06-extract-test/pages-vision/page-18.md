## Overview

This sheet contains steel column-to-beam connection typical details. The page is laid out on a numbered grid (columns 1–4 across top, rows labeled 5–12 at right/left). Only the upper portion (zones 1–4 across and down to the 8/5 row) contains drawn details; the lower portion (zones 9–12) is blank.

## Detail Zone: Column-to-Beam Connection (Top-Left, Grid 4-3)

### Column Per Plan (Elevation View)

- Column continues where occurs
- Cap Plate (PL) 3/4"
- PL 3/4" x 3" wide each side
- w/ 2-3/4" DIA. M.B.S (machine bolt, structural)
- (USE BENT "U" PLATE WHEN BEAM IS WIDER THAN COL.)
- Beam or header per plan
- Beam other side (where occurs) — TYP
- Column per plan
- N_a notation (beam seat)
- L 3) x5x5x(D+3/2") BEAM SEAT

## Detail Zone: Column Per Plan — Plans A, B, C (Top-Center, Grid 3-2)

### Plan A
- Base plate 1/2" thick on 1-1/2" min. non-shrink grout bed
- w/ 4-1/2" DIA. A.B.'s with DBL. nuts

### Plan B
- Base plate 1/2" x (steel column + 3/4")
- 1-1/2" min. non-shrink grout bed
- w/ 2-1/2" DIA. A.B.'s
- w/ DBL. nuts
- USE 18" LONG A.B.'s AT 6" CONC. CURBS AND WHERE SHEAR PANELS OCCUR(s)

### Plan C
- Use this base plate at wall corners (all items not noted same as Plan B)

### Column Per Plan — Elevation View
- 2" TYP spacing shown
- See schedule reference (SEE SCH.)
- 1-1/2" min. non-shrink grout below

### Fillet Weld Table

| Plate Thickness (Thicker Part) | Minimum Fillet Weld |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| to 1/4"                       | 1/8                 |
| Over 1/4" to 1/2"             | 3/16                |

| Over 3/4"                     | 5/16                |

## Detail Zone: Beam End and Stiffener Detail (Top-Right, Grid 2-1)

### Continue Beam Where Occurs
- Stiffener PL 3/8" each side
- Half-length dimension shown (5/16" weld TYP)
- End of beam flush where required
- TYP weld: 5/16" fillet, 5/16" shown at multiple locations

### Beam Per Plan
- Cap PL flange thickness
- (6P MIN.) x BM. flange width w/ 4-3/4" DIA. M.B.'s

### Column Per Plan
- 14" dimension shown with 2-5/8" and 11-1/2" spacing
- 1" CLR (clearance) notation

## Confidence Notes

- **High confidence:** Title block information, approval stamp, general layout and connection types
- **Medium confidence:** Some small dimensional callouts and weld symbols — the Tesseract OCR was largely garbled for this drawing-heavy page, so values are read from vision
- **Low confidence:** Some fractional dimensions in the weld table and beam seat formula may have minor reading errors due to small text

## Absent Items

- NOT SHOWN: Shearwall schedule (may be on another detail sheet)
- NOT SHOWN: Holdown schedule (may be on another detail sheet)
- NOT SHOWN: Nailing schedule
- NOT SHOWN: Foundation bolt specs
- NOT SHOWN: Slab edge detail

*Note: This page focuses specifically on steel column/beam typical connection details. Other structural details are expected on companion sheets.*
