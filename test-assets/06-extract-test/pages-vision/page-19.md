## Key Observations

- This is the foundation details sheet (S4.0) from Ramirez Structural Inc
- Heavy emphasis on drill & epoxy connections to existing concrete using Simpson SET-3G (multiple ICC-ES / ESR references: #4051, #4057, LARR #25091)
- All epoxy connections require special inspection
- Multiple details address new-to-existing foundation connections — consistent with ADU above existing garage scope
- 6" minimum embedment is the recurring spec for epoxy anchors (Detail 2, 8), 9" embedment for retrofit bolts (Detail 5, 9), 10" embed for 5/8" dia. holdown anchors (Detail 10)
- LVL stringer detail (Detail 1) shows 1-3/4" x 14" LVL @ 12" O.C. — likely floor framing for ADU above garage
- Strongwall connection detail (Detail 4) references sheet WSWH1 for anchor bolt connections
- Retrofit bolt detail (Detail 5/9) references Simpson RFB #840 with 1/2" dia. bolts
- Holdown post detail (Detail 10) uses threaded rod with 10" embedment for 5/8" dia.

## Confidence Notes

- **High confidence:** Detail titles, Simpson product references (SET-3G, RFB #840), embedment depths (6", 9", 10"), LVL stringer spec (1-3/4" x 14" @ 12" O.C.), epoxy ICC-ES report numbers, title block information, APPROVED stamp details
- **Medium confidence:** Some rebar callout values in Details 1 and 2 (partially obscured by drawing lines); exact rebar bar sizes and spacing in Details 2 and 1 (#3 x ___ @ 32" and @ 36")
- **Low confidence:** Tesseract OCR is heavily garbled for this page — nearly all OCR text is unreadable; vision extraction is the primary source for all content
