## Confidence Notes

- **High confidence**: Detail numbers, hardware callouts (H2.5, MST/A21), nailing schedules, title block information
- **Medium confidence**: Some small text labels in Details 3 and 7 where linework overlaps text
- The OCR text is heavily garbled for this drawing-intensive page; vision was the primary extraction source
