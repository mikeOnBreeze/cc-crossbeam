## Page Overview

This is a Simpson Strong-Tie manufacturer detail sheet for the Strong-Wall WSWH (Wood Shearwall High-strength) system. It contains anchorage sections, anchor bolt details, tension anchorage schedules, and shear anchorage schedules and details for 2,500, 3,000, and 4,500 PSI concrete. This is a pre-printed manufacturer reference sheet included in the plan set to document the approved strong-wall installation methods.

## General Notes (Middle Band — Below Detail 1)

1. Anchorage design conforms to ACI 318-11 Appendix D, ACI 318-14 Chapter 17, and ACI 318-19 Chapter 17
2. With no supplementary reinforcement for cracked or uncracked concrete as noted
3. Concrete must be normal weight (minimum 150 pcf)
4. Anchor bolt configurations per grade of concrete (2,500, 3,000, and 4,500 PSI)
5. Seismic anchorage design conforms to ACI 318-11 Section D.3.3.4.3, not requiring anchorage solutions above seismic design category C
6. The designer may specify alternate embedment, footing size, or anchor bolt configurations
7. Not shown for clarity: additional reinforcement requirements at certain conditions

## Foundation Plan View Detail (Middle-Left)

Shows plan view of WSWH anchorage solutions for 2800 PSI concrete:
- Strong-Wall unit placement relative to foundation
- Slab or curb and stemwall configurations
- Reinforcement layout in plan view

---

## Reinforcement Details (Middle Band)

Multiple reinforcement detail sections showing:
- **Slab or Curb Reinforcement:** Bar sizes and spacing for slab-on-grade and curb conditions
- **Grade Beam Reinforcement:** At the grade or retaining wall conditions
- **Shear Reinforcement:** Footing or grade beam reinforcement details
- **Section A:** Typical cross-section through foundation with reinforcement

### Reinforcement Configurations
- Reinforcement shown for 2,500, 3,000, and 4,500 PSI concrete conditions

## Table 1 — STRONG-WALL HIGH STRENGTH WOOD SHEARWALL TENSION ANCHORAGE SCHEDULE (Bottom-Left)

**Concrete strengths covered:** 2,500, 3,000, and 4,500 PSI

This schedule provides the tension anchorage requirements for WSWH installations including:
- WSWH model designations
- Anchor bolt configurations by concrete strength
- Footing/foundation sizing requirements
- Embedment depths
- Reinforcement requirements per concrete PSI value

**Note:** Individual cell values in this table are too small to read reliably at this resolution. The table covers anchorage configurations for the full range of WSWH models across the three concrete PSI values.

---

## Table 2 — STRONG-WALL WSWH SHEAR ANCHORAGE SCHEDULE AND DETAILS (Bottom-Center/Right)

**Title:** STRONG-WALL WSWH SHEAR ANCHORAGE

This schedule and detail set provides:
- Shear anchorage configurations for WSWH units
- Installation types (granite/concrete) and footing types
- Connection hardware and bolt specifications
- Shear capacity values per configuration

### Schedule Notes
- Shear anchorage design conforms to ACI 318-19, ACI 318-14, and ACI 318-11 standards
- Anchor bolts per specified grade of concrete
- Footing/slab minimum thickness requirements
- Fastener and hardware specifications for each installation condition

## Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Extractions
- Sheet designation: WSWH1
- Sheet title: TYPICAL DETAILS
- This is a Simpson Strong-Tie WSWH manufacturer detail sheet
- Firm: Ramirez Structural Inc., Jose Ramirez, PE
- Project No.: 25-357 (Tesseract confirms)
- Address: 326 FLINT AVE, LONG BEACH, CA 90814
- APPROVED stamp present: Anthony Montez, Building Plan Check
- Concrete PSI values covered: 2,500, 3,000, and 4,500 PSI
- ACI 318 standards referenced (318-11, 318-14, 318-19)
- Detail types: anchorage typical sections, anchor bolts, bolt extensions, bolt templates
- Installation types: slab on grade, curb/stemwall, brick ledge, interior, exterior
- WSWH-AB, WSWH-RT, WSWH-HSR, WSWH-HSR_XT, WSWH-ABE product designations visible
- Two main schedules: Tension Anchorage Schedule and Shear Anchorage Schedule

### Lower Confidence / Not Fully Legible
- Individual numeric values within the tension anchorage schedule table cells are too small to read reliably
- Individual numeric values within the shear anchorage schedule table cells are too small to read reliably
- Some reinforcement bar sizes and spacing in the detail sections are partially obscured
- Exact note numbering in the general notes section is difficult to parse due to small, dense text
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: specific anchor bolt diameters in Detail 3 table
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: specific footing dimensions in tension anchorage schedule
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: specific embedment depths per model in schedules
