## Legibility Notes

This page is a composited/tiled layout of 5-6 CF-1R form pages rendered at reduced scale with a CHEERS watermark overlay. Many specific numeric values (efficiency ratings, exact CFM values, detailed specifications) are not fully legible at this resolution. The values captured above represent best-effort extraction; items marked VALUE NOT LEGIBLE should be verified from the original CBECC-Res report or a higher-resolution source.

- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: Exact SEER2/HSPF2 ratings for heat pump
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: Exact water heater UEF rating
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: Exact HVAC fan wattage values
- VALUE NOT LEGIBLE: Some phone/certification ID digits in signature panel
