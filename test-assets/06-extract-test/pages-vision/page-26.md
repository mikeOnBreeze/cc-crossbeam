- All checklist items show triangle checkbox symbols (not checked/unchecked — appears to be informational reference summary)
- Section references consistently reference 2022 Energy Code sections (110.x, 150.x)

### Lower Confidence / Partially Legible
- Some specific section sub-references in the mandatory requirements columns are very small text and may have minor transcription errors
- The distinction between checkbox states (filled triangle vs empty triangle) is unclear at this resolution — all appear to be empty triangle markers
- Some text in the Ducts and Fans, Air Filtration, and Pool/Spa sections is very dense and may have minor omissions
- Exact wording of some checklist items in the far-right Building Envelope column is partially obscured by the revision/date block overlay
- Firm email address partial: LRG0DESIGNS411@GMAIL.COM (the "0" vs "O" is ambiguous)
